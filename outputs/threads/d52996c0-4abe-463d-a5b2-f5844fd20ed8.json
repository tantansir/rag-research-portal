  "answer": "Urban digital twins have several use cases (Wu2024, chunk_27). They can manage nearly real-time traffic information and plan accessible areas for passengers in transport studies (Lei2023, chunk_86). They can also simulate the impact of construction projects on the urban environment within city planning (Lei2023, chunk_86). Urban Digital Twins are capable of improving the resilience of urban areas against natural disasters and pandemics (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97), and a significant function is the 3-Dimensional visualization of a city or region (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97).\n\nSpecific applications include building a BIM management platform for the digital supervision of the whole life cycle of city management, covering planning, construction, management, use, and maintenance (WEF2022, chunk_95). They are used to work towards cleaner cities and reduce carbon emissions (WEF2022, chunk_95). Urban digital twins have also been utilized to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and achieve urban economic recovery (WEF2022, chunk_95), as well as in metro planning (WEF2022, chunk_95).\n\nFurthermore, digital twin technologies can contribute to the more efficient and rational use of resources (WEF2022, chunk_41), reduce the cost of urban innovation (WEF2022, chunk_41), and be used as a cloud service for enterprises and citizens to improve urban innovation (WEF2022, chunk_41). They can improve residents’ quality of life and enhance the inclusiveness of cities (WEF2022, chunk_41). This includes enhancing citizens’ sense of happiness through customized services in digital twin hospitals, classrooms, and nursing homes (WEF2022, chunk_41), and protecting citizens’ personal safety (WEF2022, chunk_41).\n\nSpecialized use cases exist across various domains, such as urban operations, governance, urban design, and the fields of architecture, construction, and engineering (ACE) (Wu2024, chunk_27). Other domains with unique use cases include transportation, environment & energy, disaster response, planning & design, and management & operation (Wu2024, chunk_27).",

Yang and Kim (2021) delineated unique use cases for different domains such as transportation, environment & energy, disaster response, planning & design, and management & operation. Similarly, Xia et al. (2022) have cataloged specialized use cases within domains such as urban operations, governance, urban design, and the fields of architecture, construction, and engineering (ACE). In an effort to harmonize these disparate approaches, Callcut et al. (2021) adopted a uniform set of use cases and tabulated their applicability in various domain-specific implementations of UDTs. By bringing attention to these domainspecific classifications of use cases, we underscore the need for standardized terminology to facilitate communication and collaboration across domains.

For example, in transport studies, urban digital twins can manage nearly real-time traffic information and plan accessible areas for passengers. Urban digital twins can also be applied to simulate e. g. the impact of construction projects on the urban environment in the scope of city planning. Therefore, rather than dive directly into practical applications of urban digital twins, it is important to have a deep discussion with practitioners to define the understanding, the purpose and the demands, tracing back to the origin [125]. Another reflection is the impact of participant’s organisations on the results. Since 44.2% of the respondents are from the research community with 26.9% from industries and 23.1%",
