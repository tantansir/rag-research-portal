  "answer": "Binyu Lei and colleagues have extensively identified and described challenges related to urban digital twins from both technical and nontechnical perspectives (Lei2023, chunk_10). Their research highlights fundamental issues such as widely varied definitions of urban digital twins, which can lead to different understandings and problems when practitioners begin projects without a consensus on what a digital twin should be (Lei2023, chunk_85). Practical values, end-user demands, and the purposes of urban digital twins are also considered main issues (Lei2023, chunk_85). Financing, specifically determining costs and benefits, is noted as one of the most severe nontechnical challenges (Lei2023, chunk_84). Other challenges include data-related issues like quality and integration (Lei2023, chunk_07), and the need for public engagement and consensus among various groups (Lei2023, chunk_81). Lei et al. also emphasize the necessity of deep discussions to synchronize understanding of digital twins among clients and partners before starting a project (Lei2023, chunk_65). Their work reveals a lengthy list of challenges pertaining to the design and implementation of urban digital twins, with technical challenges often discussed in more detail in recent papers (Lei2023, chunk_81).\n\nIn contrast, the provided evidence regarding Silvia Mazzetto's views focuses on the role of digital twins in urban design and planning, and descriptions of specific initiatives (Mazzetto2024, chunk_116). Mazzetto's work, as presented in the evidence, discusses pioneering projects like Dubai's Digital Twin and the UK's National Digital Twin Program (NDTp), which aim to facilitate integrating and sharing data to improve infrastructure management and decision-making (Mazzetto2024, chunk_116). However, the evidence does not explicitly state challenges identified by Silvia Mazzetto regarding urban digital twins.\n\nTherefore, a key difference is that Lei and colleagues explicitly detail a comprehensive list of technical and nontechnical challenges hindering the operation, design, and implementation of urban digital twins (Lei2023, chunk_10), while the provided evidence for Mazzetto focuses on describing the application and goals of urban digital twin initiatives rather than identifying or discussing specific challenges (Mazzetto2024, chunk_116). There are no direct similarities in their explicitly stated views on challenges within the provided evidence.",

Such reflections motivate us to conduct a systematic review to identify challenges in the literature considering both technical and non-technical perspectives. However, such a topic is novel in the research community, leading to a relatively small corpus of papers. Thus, the literature review gives rather an outline of challenges and falls short in gauging how severe each challenge is.

Some challenges, e. g. definitions and purposes, are fundamental issues that need to be clarified at the beginning. Although current research has defined urban digital twins in many ways, widely varied definitions may generate different situation awareness on this topic. Such ambiguity will pose problems when practitioners start a practical project on urban digital twins without a consensus on what a digital twin should be. Similarly, many panellists consider the practical values of urban digital twins as the main issues. e. g. who the endusers are, their demands, and the purposes of urban digital twins.

Accordingly, challenges identified in the current discussion are mainly data-related, such as quality and integration [19,20]. Moreover, in the operation of digital twins, relevant challenges and their interpretation primarily depend on use cases and context. Specific challenges may be highlighted, while at the same time some aspects may be neglected. For example, some digital twins are developed as an internal platform to which the public has no access. In this case, public participation and openness may not get attention. Concerning the interpretation of challenges in a certain context, one example is understanding the idea and scope of digital twins. Developing an urban",
