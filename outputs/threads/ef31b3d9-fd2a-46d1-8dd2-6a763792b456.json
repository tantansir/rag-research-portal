  "answer": "Urban digital twins have various use cases across multiple domains.\n\nOne primary application area is urban planning, design, and management, encompassing public services or management, community development, and intelligent buildings (WEF2022, chunk_70). Specific use cases include urban operations, governance, urban design, and the fields of architecture, construction, and engineering (Wu2024, chunk_27). Digital twins aid in metro planning and construction, which can significantly reduce construction costs (WEF2022, chunk_96). They also help infrastructure builders make sound digital planning decisions prior to project implementation (WEF2022, chunk_96). Furthermore, they enable digital supervision throughout the entire life cycle of a city, including planning, construction, management, use, and maintenance (WEF2022, chunk_96), (WEF2022, chunk_95). A significant function of an urban digital twin is the 3-Dimensional visualisation of the city or region (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97).\n\nIn the realm of environmental sustainability and energy management, urban digital twins are used for environmental and low-carbon development (WEF2022, chunk_70). This includes monitoring energy consumption and economic returns to help with low-carbon development (WEF2022, chunk_70). They optimize urban lighting by simulating light and shadow intensity to achieve a balance between safety requirements and energy-saving targets (WEF2022, chunk_69). Digital twins also allow urban planners to refine the use, operation, and maintenance of energy systems, record a city’s carbon trajectory, and promote carbon neutrality (WEF2022, chunk_69). They contribute to the more efficient and rational use of resources (WEF2022, chunk_41) and help achieve cleaner cities and reduced carbon emissions (WEF2022, chunk_95).\n\nFor transportation, digital twins are applied in smart transportation initiatives (WEF2022, chunk_70) and urban traffic management (WEF2022, chunk_96). They have been used in smart ports, such as the Mawan Smart Port (WEF2022, chunk_96). These technologies can monitor and predict the movement of people, places, and objects within a city, enabling comprehensive and systematic advance planning and design (WEF2022, chunk_69).\n\nUrban digital twins also enhance resilience and public safety. They can improve the resilience of urban areas against, for example, natural disasters and pandemics (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97). Specific applications include mitigating the impact of events like the COVID-19 pandemic (WEF2022, chunk_95) and protecting citizens’ personal safety (WEF2022, chunk_41).\n\nIn terms of quality of life and services, digital twins can significantly improve residents’ quality of life and enhance the inclusiveness of cities (WEF2022, chunk_41). They enhance citizens’ sense of happiness through the integration of virtual and real scenarios, providing full-range, full-time, customized services in digital twin hospitals, classrooms, and nursing homes (WEF2022, chunk_41). Furthermore, they can help achieve urban economic recovery (WEF2022, chunk_95) and reduce the cost of urban innovation by serving as a cloud service for enterprises and citizens (WEF2022, chunk_41).",

From the cases collected for this report, the top three application scenarios in digital twin city construction are: 1) public services or management; 2) community development; and 3) intelligent buildings, accounting for 55.6%, 44.4% and 40.7% respectively. Of all Chinese digital twin practices, 54% are related to smart transportation and 31% to smart communities. In global terms, more than 40% of practices focus on environmental and low-carbon development.

At each phase, urban digital twins has been hampered by different challenges. The mapping provides insight into what challenges are mainly experienced during the different stages. Therefore, it can reflect the current development of digital twins and facilitate stakeholders to understand the status quo.
