## Research Question

List the use cases of urban digital twin.

## Synthesis

Urban digital twins have several use cases (Wu2024, chunk_27). They can manage nearly real-time traffic information and plan accessible areas for passengers in transport studies (Lei2023, chunk_86). They can also simulate the impact of construction projects on the urban environment within city planning (Lei2023, chunk_86). Urban Digital Twins are capable of improving the resilience of urban areas against natural disasters and pandemics (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97), and a significant function is the 3-Dimensional visualization of a city or region (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97).

Specific applications include building a BIM management platform for the digital supervision of the whole life cycle of city management, covering planning, construction, management, use, and maintenance (WEF2022, chunk_95). They are used to work towards cleaner cities and reduce carbon emissions (WEF2022, chunk_95). Urban digital twins have also been utilized to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and achieve urban economic recovery (WEF2022, chunk_95), as well as in metro planning (WEF2022, chunk_95).

Furthermore, digital twin technologies can contribute to the more efficient and rational use of resources (WEF2022, chunk_41), reduce the cost of urban innovation (WEF2022, chunk_41), and be used as a cloud service for enterprises and citizens to improve urban innovation (WEF2022, chunk_41). They can improve residents’ quality of life and enhance the inclusiveness of cities (WEF2022, chunk_41). This includes enhancing citizens’ sense of happiness through customized services in digital twin hospitals, classrooms, and nursing homes (WEF2022, chunk_41), and protecting citizens’ personal safety (WEF2022, chunk_41).

Specialized use cases exist across various domains, such as urban operations, governance, urban design, and the fields of architecture, construction, and engineering (ACE) (Wu2024, chunk_27). Other domains with unique use cases include transportation, environment & energy, disaster response, planning & design, and management & operation (Wu2024, chunk_27).
