The construction of digital twins is typically driven by the interests of the developers, which is not a usercentred design [37]. As a result, not all types of users are considered in this process, such as vulnerable groups and nonexperts. Furthermore, it also questions to what extent participatory feedback would be reflected in digital twins and how the communication loop could be shaped through the interaction between human and digital twins [1,83]. Financing is crucial to operating digital twins. The first aspect is associated with equipment cost. In many cases, it refers to the cost of getting software licences, requiring commercial data, or purchasing devices [100].

In the context of urban village detection algorithms, scalability refers to the algorithm’s ability to handle growing data volumes and complexity efficiently, while transferability denotes its capacity to be adapted effectively to different geographic regions or urban environments.

First, data accuracy is discussed with specific cases, such as integration and segmentation [84, 108,109]. Some errors occur when integrating 3D buildings with terrain models, such as partially floating or sinking building objects or unknown underground depth [108]. The results from such a case may affect further analysis and lead to wrong conclusions. The second issue is data availability [85]. In some cases, data collected from multiple organisations are unstructured and noisy [83,86].
