A digital twin is a pairing of the virtual and physical worlds that allows for analysis of data and monitoring of systems to head off problems before they occur, prevent downtime and can even be used to plan for the future using simulations (Boschert & Rosen, 2016). Digital twins have primarily been used in the manufacturing sector, but other areas of study and business are beginning to find new potential uses.

In particular, each device equipped with one or more sensors will be expected to collect its local sensing information. The acquired local data can then be projected onto a 3D map to generate a real-time digital twin. This, in general, will help generate a partial view of the entire map, resulting in a localized digital twin. This local realtime digital twin can then be utilized to facilitate the sensing and wireless communication decision-making process. An advantage to such a local approach is that the limited sensing information captured by each device can be processed locally (on the device or edge), reducing the downstream processing and decision-making latency.
