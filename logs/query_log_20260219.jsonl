Similarly, one of the perspectives in Mazzetto's work, the \"Cautious Critique,\" expresses concerns about data quality and ethics in decision-making (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_78). This perspective also questions the reliability of data and simulation models for decision-making (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_99).\n*   **Need for Awareness and Understanding**: Lei's study finds that a lack of understanding about digital twins is a severe non-technical challenge, necessitating deep discussions to create a synchronized understanding before projects begin (Lei2023, chunk_65) (Lei2023, chunk_84). This aligns with a view in Mazzetto's work that policymakers and stakeholders need to be more aware and informed about UDTs (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95). Furthermore, one perspective in Mazzetto’s research notes that decision-makers require more training before UDTs can be widely adopted (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95).\n*   **Socio-Political Concerns**: Lei's research highlights public engagement from a social perspective (Lei2023, chunk_81). Mazzetto's work also emphasizes these aspects, with the \"Cautious Critique\" perspective calling for more research into the ethical, social, and political consequences of UDTs (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95). Mazzetto's research concludes that political, social, and economic implications are more significant than the technical definitions of UDTs (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_78).\n\n### Differences\nThe primary differences lie in the framing of the challenges and the specific areas of emphasis.\n\n*   **Framing of Challenges**: Lei's research, which combines a systematic review and a Delphi survey, presents a comprehensive list of technical and non-technical challenges (Lei2023, chunk_81) (Lei2023, chunk_25). In contrast, Mazzetto's work frames the challenges through three distinct actor perspectives: \"Strategic Confidence,\" \"Cautious Critique,\" and \"Technological Pragmatism,\" focusing on the areas of agreement and divergence between them (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_70) (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_78).\n*   **Areas of Emphasis**: Lei maps the identified challenges to the different phases of a digital twin's life cycle (Lei2023, chunk_84). The study also notes that technical challenges are discussed in more detail in recent literature (Lei2023, chunk_81). Mazzetto’s work, however, places a stronger emphasis on the political, social, and economic implications surrounding UDT adoption over their definitions and technical features (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_78).\n*   **Specific Issues Mentioned**: Lei's work explicitly identifies financing, such as determining costs and benefits, as a practical challenge requiring effort (Lei2023, chunk_84). Conversely, a perspective in Mazzetto's research raises the specific concern that digital twins could become a \"technological monstrosity in the hands of Big Tech\" (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_99), a viewpoint not mentioned in the provided excerpts from Lei's work.", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Apeldoorn2025", "chunk_id": "chunk_70", "text": "s that highlight areas of agreement and divergence.

Their research highlights fundamental issues such as widely varied definitions of urban digital twins, which can lead to different understandings and problems when practitioners begin projects without a consensus on what a digital twin should be (Lei2023, chunk_85). Practical values, end-user demands, and the purposes of urban digital twins are also considered main issues (Lei2023, chunk_85). Financing, specifically determining costs and benefits, is noted as one of the most severe nontechnical challenges (Lei2023, chunk_84). Other challenges include data-related issues like quality and integration (Lei2023, chunk_07), and the need for public engagement and consensus among various groups (Lei2023, chunk_81). Lei et al. also emphasize the necessity of deep discussions to synchronize understanding of digital twins among clients and partners before starting a project (Lei2023, chunk_65). Their work reveals a lengthy list of challenges pertaining to the design and implementation of urban digital twins, with technical challenges often discussed in more detail in recent papers (Lei2023, chunk_81).\n\nIn contrast, the provided evidence regarding Silvia Mazzetto's views focuses on the role of digital twins in urban design and planning, and descriptions of specific initiatives (Mazzetto2024, chunk_116).

In general, the needs of urban digital twins vary in different cases. For example, in transport studies, urban digital twins can manage nearly real-time traffic information and plan accessible areas for passengers. Urban digital twins can also be applied to simulate e. g. the impact of construction projects on the urban environment in the scope of city planning. Therefore, rather than dive directly into practical applications of urban digital twins, it is important to have a deep discussion with practitioners to define the understanding, the purpose and the demands, tracing back to the origin [125].
