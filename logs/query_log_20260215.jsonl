Its specific uses and applications include:\n\n*   **Wireless Communication and Networking:** By employing real-time ray tracing, the digital twin infers channel and geometry information to support wireless networks (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09). It tracks the motion of users and objects in the environment to proactively predict the occurrence and duration of signal blockages before they happen (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_32). This awareness allows mobile users or networks to predict if line-of-sight links will be blocked by moving scatterers and to initiate seamless handovers or beam switches (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_17).\n*   **Emerging Applications:** The digital twin supports applications with stringent reliability and latency requirements, such as autonomous driving and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_32).\n*   **Layered Integration:** It operates across various functional layers, including the physical, MAC, network, and application layers, to enhance the overall end-user experience (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_31).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Alkhateeb2023", "chunk_id": "chunk_09", "text": ".\n(Position/Mobility)\nUser Vehicle\nPosition Radar Desicions Task Solving\nVehicle Configurations\nLiDAR Operations\nFig.1.

Real-time 3D maps serve as the base upon which the digital twin is built (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09).\n*   **High-Fidelity and Multi-Modal Sensing**: The architecture requires the fusion of multi-modal sensory data gathered from distributed devices and infrastructure nodes (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_06). High-fidelity sensing is explicitly identified as one of the four key enablers of the digital twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09).\n*   **Real-Time Ray Tracing**: This computational component is essential for inferring channel information and geometry to facilitate various applications (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09). It enables the digital twin to make real-time decisions with rich awareness of the surrounding environment (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_17).\n*   **Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ML/DL)**: These are categorized as key enablers alongside mapping and sensing technologies (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09). Digital twins utilize these for training models or making real-time decisions (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_17).\n*   **Multi-Source Data Integration Agents**: For urban prediction tasks, systems may employ agents to integrate diverse urban information sources, such as street-view imagery and Point of Interest (POI) queries, often utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) (Lou2025, chunk_12).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Alkhateeb2023", "chunk_id": "chunk_17", "text": ". this channel, which saves large channel training and feedback\noverhead.

Researchers conduct simulations using specific infrastructure configurations, such as 50 EVs and 500 solar panels, alongside distinct weather datasets to capture seasonal variations (DoBui2025, chunk_52). Performance is evaluated through quantitative metrics like total energy consumption, renewable energy usage, and self-sufficiency percentages (DoBui2025, chunk_52). Statistical methods, such as the Wilcoxon test, are employed to determine if differences in results—such as those between scenarios with and without wind energy integration—are statistically significant (DoBui2025, chunk_54).\n\n**Urban Environments**\nFor urban digital twins, the methodology shifts to spatial data analysis and statistical modeling. Researchers utilize Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) models to evaluate relationships between variables, calculating direct, indirect (spillover), and total effects to understand spatial influence (Collins2023, chunk_29). Detailed mathematical formulas are used to isolate these effects and interpret the influence of one spatial unit on another (Collins2023, chunk_30). Additionally, specific indices such as the Shannon-Wiener diversity index are calculated using data from \"Points of Interest\" collections found in OpenStreetMap to assess urban features like vibrancy (Collins2023, chunk_20).\n\n**Manufacturing and Business**\nIn manufacturing contexts, the evaluation framework focuses on cost efficiency and risk mitigation (\"Target Costing\"). Digital twins are used to test radical changes, such as modifying processes or machinery, within a virtual environment (Yukcu2021, chunk_08). This approach is preferred because physical changes are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, whereas digital adjustments are easier and cheaper to evaluate (Yukcu2021, chunk_08).\n\n**Wireless Systems**\nFor wireless systems envisioned for 6G, evaluation methodologies center on the technical capability to support real-time operations. The approach involves leveraging precise 3D maps and fusing multi-modal sensory data to construct accurate real-time replicas (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_06). The evaluation includes assessing the system's ability to make real-time decisions using technologies like 3D ray-tracing (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_06).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "DoBui2025", "chunk_id": "chunk_54", "text": "0.54 (SD = 0.11).

By tracking the motion of users and objects, these systems can proactively predict signal blockages and manage seamless handover controls to improve network reliability (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_32).\n\n**Autonomous Driving and Mobility**\nAutonomous driving is highlighted as a primary application trend for digital twins (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_08). These systems support the stringent reliability and latency requirements needed for safety-critical applications in mobility (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_32). Digital twins can also track vehicle configurations and user positions (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09).\n\n**Immersive Technologies (AR/VR/Metaverse)**\nThe rise of the metaverse and Augmented Reality/Extended Reality (AR/XR) technologies has driven demand for the precise 3D map data used in digital twins (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09). These technologies are considered key current application trends supported by digital twin infrastructure (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_08).\n\n**Urban Dynamics and Social Analysis**\nPlanners use multi-source urban data to perform robust urban predictions, such as estimating the amount of people running or assessing \"urban perception\" metrics like boringness (Lou2025, chunk_12). Digital representations of city features—such as networks and buildings—are also used to analyze urban vibrancy and understand differences between social groups, such as gender-based usage of space (Collins2023, chunk_14).\n\n**Energy System Management**\nDigital twins enable the simulation of energy systems, such as the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels (DoBui2025, chunk_52). These simulations allow planners to analyze total energy consumption, renewable energy usage, and self-sufficiency under various seasonal weather conditions (DoBui2025, chunk_52).\n\n**Surveillance**\nReal-time surveillance is also identified as a component within digital twin frameworks (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_08).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Alkhateeb2023", "chunk_id": "chunk_09", "text": ".\n(Position/Mobility)\nUser Vehicle\nPosition Radar Desicions Task Solving\nVehicle Configurations\nLiDAR Operations\nFig.1.

Systems are tested using distinct weather datasets, such as quarterly averages, to analyze the impact of seasonal fluctuations on solar energy output and electricity demand (DoBui2025, chunk_52). Key performance metrics include total energy consumption, renewable energy usage, self-sufficiency percentages, and financial returns (DoBui2025, chunk_52). Furthermore, statistical analysis, such as the Wilcoxon test, is employed to validate the significance of performance differences when comparing different configurations, such as the integration of wind energy versus battery expansion (DoBui2025, chunk_54).\n\n**Telecommunications (6G and mmWave)**\nFor telecommunications networks, specifically high-frequency 6G systems, evaluation focuses on reliability, latency, and predictive capabilities. Digital twins are assessed on their ability to track the motion of users and objects to proactively predict blockage occurrences and durations (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_32). The performance criteria are stringent, with systems envisioned to support \"9-nine\" reliability and latencies as low as 0.1 ms for safety-critical applications (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_32). Additionally, the methodology involves evaluating the efficiency of cooperative sensing protocols to ensure the transfer of optimum data required for generating an accurate twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_47).\n\n**Manufacturing and Business**\nIn manufacturing contexts, the evaluation methodology is centered on cost reduction and risk mitigation during the design and process planning phases. Digital twins allow for the simulation of radical changes to processes or machinery, enabling businesses to evaluate improvements without the high difficulty and expense associated with physical modifications (Yukcu2021, chunk_08).

This allows planners to observe real-time interactions and calculations to assess the viability of a plan before implementation (DoBui2025, chunk_50).\n*   **Infrastructure Management and Optimization**: The ability to simulate scenarios significantly improves the efficiency of decision-making (DoBui2025, chunk_50).

The objective is to create a digital representation that updates and changes in real-time as its physical counterpart changes (White2021, chunk_06).\n\n**Data Collection and Infrastructure**\nThe integration of real-time data relies on a physical infrastructure of sensors (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_46). Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are considered a key component, particularly in the context of complex urban digital twins (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_96). The creation of data is dependent on the construction of this hardware, such as a network of urban sensors (Lei2023, chunk_73). This setup allows for data to be gathered and for the physical twin to be monitored without needing a direct physical connection to the sensors (Barbie2023a, chunk_51).\n\n**Data Processing Models**\nOnce collected, the sensor data can be processed in different ways:\n\n*   **Centralized Processing**: In some systems, sensing data from various devices is transferred quickly to a central unit for processing (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). The effectiveness of this model is dependent on the available communication bandwidth, as the data transfer rate must accommodate the increasing amount of sensing data (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45).\n*   **Localized Processing**: An alternative approach involves devices with sensors collecting local information (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). This local data can be projected onto a 3D map to generate a localized real-time digital twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). A key advantage of this model is that the data can be processed locally, either on the device or at the edge, which reduces latency (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). However, this method may be limited by its partial view of the entire system (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23).\n\n**Challenges in Integration**\nSeveral challenges can hinder the effective integration of real-time sensor data. These include uneven data-collection capabilities, inconsistent multidimensional data, and the uneven construction of IoT sensing facilities (WEF2022, chunk_129). Furthermore, using heterogeneous data acquisition techniques can negatively affect the overall quality and resolution of the collected information (Lei2023, chunk_73). The lack of standardized governance for varied urban data sources also presents a challenge, as there is no unified standard system for digital twin cities currently in development (WEF2022, chunk_129).

City authorities use digital twins for urban planning and governance, as they contribute to better management and decision-making in the real world (Lei2023, chunk_16). They offer cities a promising way to address complex urban problems (Wu2024, chunk_02).\n\nA primary use case for digital twins in urban planning is the ability to simulate different scenarios (Lei2023, chunk_16). These simulations help policymakers and planners consider potential circumstances to find optimal solutions (Lei2023, chunk_05). By testing scenarios in a virtual model, decision-makers can reduce negative impacts on the physical environment, save resources, and make better choices (Lei2023, chunk_16). Specific simulation applications include:\n*   **Construction and Infrastructure**: Digital twins are used to simulate planned construction projects (Lei2023, chunk_05). This can involve assessing the impact of these projects on the urban environment (Lei2023, chunk_86). They also facilitate decisions on projects like building a new community center or constructing new cycling paths (Lei2023, chunk_05).\n*   **Disaster Management and Safety**: Digital twins have applications in disaster management (Lei2023, chunk_05). For instance, they can be used to simulate rescue operations to ensure the safety of rescue teams by testing multiple options to find the best-case scenario (White2021, chunk_09).\n*   **Transportation**: In transport studies, urban digital twins can manage nearly real-time traffic information (Lei2023, chunk_86). They are also used to plan accessible areas for passengers (Lei2023, chunk_86).\n\nBeyond simulation, urban digital twins are used for data integration and stakeholder collaboration. One of their most important functions is to integrate and harmonize large quantities of geodata (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95). This capability allows them to integrate the plans of different stakeholders into a single, integrated urban design (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95).

One of the most popular definitions is from the field of aerospace — it describes the digital twin as an integrated multi-scale simulation of the physical entity to mirror the life of its corresponding twin [26].

This architecture merges several individual twins into a unified urban information model (Jeddoub2023, chunk_48). In contrast, building-level digital twins focus on individual structures (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81). While the general concept of a digital twin includes a physical entity, a virtual entity, and a data connection, the complexity of these components varies with scale (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_12). Some implementations referred to as \"City Digital Twins\" are static replicas of a city that mainly focus on buildings, blurring the lines between the two scales (Jeddoub2023, chunk_46).\n\n**Architectural Framework and Components:**\nThe architectural frameworks for each level differ significantly in scope.\n*   **City-Level:** The construction of a digital twin city involves a comprehensive \"4+5\" framework (WEF2022, chunk_53). This architecture includes four core elements: infrastructure, data resources, platform capacity, and application scenarios (WEF2022, chunk_53). It also incorporates five external elements: strategy and mechanisms, stakeholders, funding and business models, standards, and cybersecurity (WEF2022, chunk_53).\n*   **Building-Level:** Architectural Digital Twins, which are similar to building digital twins, have key components that include 2D/3D data, data representation, and validation (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n\n**Focus and Application:**\nThe intended applications differ based on the architectural scale.\n*   **City-Level:** A digital twin city's goal is to map the physical city to solve complexity and uncertainty in broad domains like urban planning, design, construction, management, and services (WEF2022, chunk_13). These twins provide a spatial context for the city's objects, infrastructures, and systems (Jeddoub2023, chunk_48).\n*   **Building-Level:** Building and architectural digital twins are focused on more specific tasks such as accurate modeling, managing individual structures, ensuring long-term operational efficiency, and supporting long-term planning decisions (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n\nIt is important to note that the concept of a digital twin for cities is relatively new and still faces challenges like fragmented understanding (WEF2022, chunk_13) (Jeddoub2023, chunk_02). While their architectures differ, one analysis suggests that both building and urban digital twins do not necessarily require the same real-time response capabilities as digital twins in other fields, such as manufacturing (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_83).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Abdelrahman2025", "chunk_id": "chunk_81", "text": "hey help in accurate modeling, managing structures, and ensuring longterm operational efficiency. • Architectural Digital Twins: Similar to building digital twins, these are focused on long-term planning and decision support, leveraging detailed data representation and validation.

While traditional simulations can model urban scenarios, a digital twin is a persistent \"living\" virtual model that mirrors a real-world city or urban area (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_95).\n\nKey distinctions highlighted in the sources include:\n\n*   **Two-Way Interaction:** A defining feature of a digital twin is a two-way data flow between the physical and virtual worlds (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68). This establishes a \"simultaneous operation of and interaction between the physical and digital dimensions of the city\" (WEF2022, chunk_14). This continuous, interactive link is not an inherent feature of a traditional simulation.\n*   **Real-Time Data:** Digital twins mirror the states of their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle, often using data from IoT sensors (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_95). This creates a virtual representation of the \"current (physical) reality of the city\" (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_93). The usefulness of a digital twin depends on how comprehensive this available data is (White2021, chunk_07).\n*   **Simulation as a Function:** The evidence frames simulation as a *capability* of a digital twin, rather than a separate concept (WEF2022, chunk_13). Digital twins *enable* analytical operations and simulations within the virtual environment (Lei2023, chunk_04). For example, planners can use a digital twin to simulate and evaluate the impact of different scenarios, such as planned construction or disaster management (Lei2023, chunk_04) (Lei2023, chunk_16). A digital twin can be extended to \"simulate and predict various states and scenarios\" to aid decision-making (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_95).\n*   **Lifecycle Integration:** A digital twin is an integrated model that reflects the \"full life cycle of the physical entity\" by using sensor data, physical models, and operational history (WEF2022, chunk_25).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Lei2023", "chunk_id": "chunk_04", "text": "dict [1,2].

This can be implemented through a \"dual-variant and conflict-repair mechanism\" (Lou2025, chunk_14). In this approach, an \"Extractor\" agent generates two independent output variants, which are then compared by an \"Evaluator\" agent (Lou2025, chunk_14). If the outputs disagree, a \"Refiner\" agent selectively re-extracts only the conflicting information to produce reliable results (Lou2025, chunk_14). Such mechanisms are designed to verify and enhance the reliability of extracted information (Lou2025, chunk_08). This approach can strengthen multi-source integration and ensure consistent information across different dimensions and levels (Lou2025, chunk_14).\n\nAnother recommended strategy is to use diverse data sources for cross-checking information (Cao2025, chunk_78). These sources can serve as a reference to help label high-quality data for training and validation purposes (Cao2025, chunk_78). This is important because integrating data from multiple sources can lead to errors, such as inaccuracies when combining 3D building models with terrain, which can affect analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions (Lei2023, chunk_39).\n\nFor systematic reviews, a recommended practice is to use standardized tools to evaluate the quality of source materials (Luo2025, chunk_24). One example is the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist, which is used to assess the rigor and reliability of studies (Luo2025, chunk_24).\n\nIn the context of model performance, evaluation should extend beyond simple accuracy metrics (Cao2025, chunk_80). It is important to assess the transferability of models across different regions, contexts, and data scales, an area where research is currently limited (Cao2025, chunk_80).

In this structure, the platform acts as a core hub (WEF2022, chunk_66). It connects to various infrastructures below it to aggregate data, and it supports the development of applications above it (WEF2022, chunk_66). This platform provides capabilities such as digital twin simulation and spatial computing (WEF2022, chunk_66).\n\nAnother architectural perspective is the five-dimensional model, which consists of physical entities, virtual entities, service, twin data, and connections (WEF2022, chunk_28). The purpose of these components is to create a virtual model that can simulate the behavior of its physical counterpart using data (WEF2022, chunk_28).\n\nDifferent organizations highlight various key elements and capabilities:\n*   **PwC** states that a digital twin system includes infrastructure, connectivity networks, platforms, applications, data standards and management, and security and privacy (WEF2022, chunk_151).\n*   **Deloitte** identifies six elements that drive digital twin development: simulation technology, new data sources, interoperability, instrumentation, visualization, and platforms (WEF2022, chunk_151).\n*   **CAICT** notes that digital twin cities cover technologies like new mapping, simulation, and deep learning, and it presents nine core capabilities, including IoT perception and manipulation, digital representation of all elements, visualization, and data fusion (WEF2022, chunk_151). The integration of IoT, predictive analytics, and scenario simulation is essential for managing urban infrastructure efficiently (Mazzetto2024, chunk_102).\n\nThe lifecycle of a digital twin also points to necessary architectural functions, such as data acquisition, data processing, dissemination through visualization, ensuring interoperability, and maintenance for model updates (Lei2023, chunk_20).

These real-time updates are facilitated by sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_58).\n\n### Data Collection and Transmission\nThe integration process begins with the physical installation of sensors on a platform, followed by building and deploying the necessary device drivers (Barbie2023a, chunk_30). Devices equipped with sensors, such as LiDAR, radar, or surveillance cameras, collect local sensing information (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09) (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). This aggregated sensor data is then transmitted to the digital twin (Barbie2023a, chunk_23). Technologies like 5G and a combination of edge and cloud computing are explored to improve this data sharing (Mazzetto2024, chunk_52).\n\n### Data Processing and Management\nTo handle challenges like sensor data overload, digital twin systems utilize edge and fog computing to manage the flow of data (Mazzetto2024, chunk_52). Processing information locally on the device or at the edge can reduce the latency associated with downstream processing and decision-making (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). Artificial intelligence (AI) may also be adopted for more efficient data collection and processing (Mazzetto2024, chunk_52).\n\n### Standardization and Application\nTo address interoperability issues between different data domains, standardized frameworks are implemented (Mazzetto2024, chunk_52). For example, the FIWARE smart data model uses the NGSI-LD standard to harmonize sensor streams and integrate platforms under a unified data format (Jeddoub2023, chunk_26). Once integrated, the sensor data is used to construct and update the digital twin, often by projecting the information onto a 3D map to generate a real-time view (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09) (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). This provides near real-time insights that can be used to monitor a system's \"health\" or provide valuable feedback to operators (Dawkins2025, chunk_15) (Barbie2023a, chunk_23).\n\nDuring the development phase, a \"Digital Twin Prototype\" approach can be used where sensor interfaces are integrated into the process (Barbie2023a, chunk_02). In this approach, emulated hardware provides inputs and outputs that match the real hardware, allowing the system to be a valid source for automated software testing (Barbie2023a, chunk_02).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Mazzetto2024", "chunk_id": "chunk_52", "text": "Integration of diverse data collection technologies. - Real-time data analytics and processing. - Sensor data overload and multitasking conflicts. - Utilization of edge and fog computing to manage data flow. - Adoption of AI for efficient data collection and processing. - Enhancing sensor capabilities to support comprehensive data sets.

For example, feedback data from citizens can be used to inform decisions about the size and placement of infrastructure like offshore wind turbines (White2021, chunk_30). Digital twins can also run simulations to show how proposed buildings might affect sunlight in public parks, allowing for human-centric evaluation before construction (White2021, chunk_30).\n\n*   **Building Stakeholder Consensus**: Developing an urban digital twin involves multiple groups, and stakeholders with different backgrounds often have different viewpoints (Lei2023, chunk_08). Therefore, a crucial practice is to reach a consensus by determining the interests of these various groups before beginning a new development cycle (Lei2023, chunk_81). This requires cooperation among multi-stakeholders to ensure the technology is understood and a governance framework is agreed upon (WEF2022, chunk_22).\n\n*   **Improving Accessibility and Usability**: To attract more practitioners and key stakeholders, interfaces are designed to lower the technical threshold for use (WEF2022, chunk_141).

Their use cases span several key areas of urban planning.\n\n### Planning, Design, and Policy\nA primary function of a UDT is the 3-dimensional visualization of a city or region (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_97). These technologies enable city planners to carry out digital design work quickly and conveniently (WEF2022, chunk_46). Digital twins are used to model urban planning and policy decisions (White2021, chunk_09). This allows city managers to analyze and deduce the effects of policy decisions at any time (WEF2022, chunk_46). UDTs may also be used to mediate spatial conflicts (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_96).\n\n### Simulation and Analysis\nSimulations are a common application for urban digital twins (Lei2023, chunk_05). UDTs can simulate the impact of planned construction projects on the urban environment (Lei2023, chunk_86). Specific examples include planning for a new community center or constructing cycling paths (Lei2023, chunk_05). Other types of simulations that can be conducted include traffic and rainfall (Jeddoub2023, chunk_118).\n\n### Disaster Management and Resilience\nDigital twins are applied in disaster management and response (Lei2023, chunk_05) (Wu2024, chunk_27). For example, they can simulate rescue operations to test multiple options and ensure the safety of emergency teams (White2021, chunk_09). More broadly, UDTs can enhance the resilience of cities against threats such as natural disasters and pandemics (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_96).\n\n### Operations and Management\nOne of the most important functions of a UDT is real-time measurement and monitoring (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_98). In transportation studies, they can manage near real-time traffic information and help plan accessible areas for passengers (Lei2023, chunk_86). City builders can also use the technology to dispatch resources and monitor the progress of projects remotely (WEF2022, chunk_46).

Urban digital twins can also be applied to simulate e. g. the impact of construction projects on the urban environment in the scope of city planning. Therefore, rather than dive directly into practical applications of urban digital twins, it is important to have a deep discussion with practitioners to define the understanding, the purpose and the demands, tracing back to the origin [125].

Organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have given attention to digital twins, and various national bodies have proposed standardization targets based on application scenarios (WEF2022, chunk_91).\n\n### Performance Metrics\nSpecific metrics are used to evaluate the performance of machine and deep learning models within digital twins (Liu2023, chunk_52).\n*   **Accuracy** is one evaluation metric used in experiments (Liu2023, chunk_52).\n*   **F-score** is another metric used, particularly for imbalanced datasets (Liu2023, chunk_52). The F-score is considered a harmonic mean of precision and recall (Liu2023, chunk_52).\n\n### Testing and Validation Approaches\nSeveral testing frameworks and techniques are employed to validate digital twin systems:\n*   **In-the-Loop Techniques**: Cost-saving techniques like Model-in-the-Loop (MIL), Software-in-the-Loop (SIL), and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) are utilized to validate and verify embedded software systems (Barbie2023a, chunk_06).\n*   **Digital Twin Prototype (DTP)**: This approach enables automated integration testing of embedded software systems (Barbie2023a, chunk_06).\n*   **Automated Testing**: Automated testing can be implemented through continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines (Barbie2023a, chunk_21). Messages exchanged between the physical and digital twins can be recorded and used to enhance the quality of these CI/CD pipelines (Barbie2023a, chunk_21).\n\n### System and Data Evaluation\nEvaluation can also extend to the digital twin system's components and overall readiness:\n*   **Data Validation**: This refers to control measures that ensure data meets the required quality and accuracy (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_63).\n*   **Readiness Levels**: Some frameworks assess the technological and societal readiness of Urban Digital Twins based on factors like implementation phase and public acceptance (Wu2024, chunk_58). However, these measures are often qualitative and can be subjective (Wu2024, chunk_58).\n*   **Service Indicators**: A system of indicators named \"Digital Twin DNA,\" based on ISO standards, has been introduced to allow for the comparison of city services across different locations (Wu2024, chunk_58).\n*   **Continuous Improvement**: \"True digital twins\" can be viewed as machine learning models that continuously learn from prior decisions and feedback to improve their modeling accuracy over time (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_21).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "WEF2022", "chunk_id": "chunk_91", "text": "standardization projects Standards and evaluation Standards and evaluation are the regulations followed in the construction of digital twin cities; they are also important references for the evaluation of digital twin city project operations.

This structure is found in nearly half of Urban Digital Twin (UDT) architectures and is similar to smart city architectures (Wu2024, chunk_81). These systems typically consist of layers for data collection, data processing, and application, and sometimes include a human-computer interaction layer (Wu2024, chunk_81).

Its lower levels include:\n*   **Smart Connection**: This level manages the data exchange between the Physical Twin (PT) and the Digital Twin (DT) (Talasila2023, chunk_08).\n*   **Data-to-information conversion**: This stage is for converting and aggregating data to make it useful for monitoring (Talasila2023, chunk_08).\n*   **Cyber**: This is the central information level (Talasila2023, chunk_08).\n\nAnother architectural framework mentioned is Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS), which has an associated Architecture Reference Model (Talasila2023, chunk_49).\n\nA foundational element of these architectures is the data exchange between the physical object and its digital representation (Talasila2023, chunk_08).

The level of automation in this data exchange can define the type of digital twin system (Talasila2023, chunk_08). These categories include a \"Digital Model\" with no automated exchange, a \"Digital Shadow\" with one-way automated data flow from the physical to the digital twin, and a \"Digital Twin\" with two-way automated data exchange (Talasila2023, chunk_08).

This variation is a key area of study in citizen-centric UDT research (Luo2025, chunk_10). At the lower end of this spectrum, some urban projects rely on one-way information flows, such as static Web-GIS dashboards or 3D viewers, which present a proposed plan and ask for minimal feedback (Luo2025, chunk_61). In contrast, other implementations provide publicly accessible models that allow users to actively interact, leave feedback on planning decisions, and tag problems in their area (White2021, chunk_10). The goal is to move beyond basic consultation to achieve genuine collaborative planning (Luo2025, chunk_69).\n\n**Design Philosophy and Stakeholder Inclusion**\nA fundamental difference lies in the design's focus. The construction of digital twins is often driven by developer interests rather than being a user-centered design (Lei2023, chunk_56). This developer-centric approach can lead to the exclusion of certain users, such as vulnerable groups and non-experts (Lei2023, chunk_56). Ideally, UDTs should foster a human-centric planning process where citizens' perceptual insights are used to refine designs (Luo2025, chunk_21).\n\nThe scale and type of participant engagement vary significantly across studies (Luo2025, chunk_51). The development of a UDT involves multiple groups of stakeholders who often have different backgrounds and viewpoints (Lei2023, chunk_08). In reported studies, academics were the most frequent end-users (47.6%), followed by diverse stakeholders like students and building managers (20.2%), and then government departments (15.5%) (Luo2025, chunk_51).\n\n**Feedback and Integration Challenges**\nHow citizen feedback is handled and integrated also differs. It is a known challenge to determine the extent to which participatory feedback is reflected in the digital twins themselves (Lei2023, chunk_56). From a social perspective, a key goal is to reflect feedback on the digital models and achieve consensus by understanding the interests of various groups (Lei2023, chunk_81). Some research points to a disconnect from established participatory paradigms like Public Participation GIS (PPGIS), highlighting a \"participation gap\" (Luo2025, chunk_69). To bridge this gap, UDTs could incorporate proven methodologies that empower diverse communities to contribute data and local knowledge, fostering more democratic co-creation (Luo2025, chunk_69).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Luo2025", "chunk_id": "chunk_61", "text": "lic participation effectiveness and inclusivity. 4.3.3.

Table 3 summarizes the distribution of cases across four operational tiers, cross-tabulated by urban versus rural/peri-urban context and by the visual/technical set-ups that enabled interaction.

This thematic inconsistency highlights a disconnect from established participatory paradigms within geographic information science. Bridging this participation gap requires moving beyond bespoke UDT interfaces towards more scalable and inclusive frameworks inspired by Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) (Jeansoulin, 2025). These fields have a long history of developing tools and methodologies that empower large, diverse communities to contribute geospatial data and local knowledge, fostering a more democratic form of data co-creation (Haklay, 2012; Luo et al., 2025 a).

In contrast, city-level, or Urban Digital Twins (UDTs), operate on a much larger scale, representing a \"system of systems\" that integrates multiple individual twins into a common urban information model (Jeddoub2023, chunk_48). A city-level twin is a living digital representation of a city's objects, infrastructures, systems, and processes (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68).\n\n### Architectural Components and Framework\nThe architectural components of building-level twins are primarily 2D/3D data, data representation, and visualization, often used for applications like Building Information Models (BIM) and lifecycle management (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_80). Architectural Digital Twins, which are similar to BDTs, also focus on detailed data representation and validation for long-term planning (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n\nCity-level digital twins utilize a more complex framework (WEF2022, chunk_53). One proposed framework consists of four core elements: infrastructure, data resources, platform capacity, and application scenarios (WEF2022, chunk_53). In this architecture, a central platform serves as a core hub (WEF2022, chunk_66). This platform connects to various infrastructures, aggregates multisource data, and provides capabilities such as digital twin simulation and spatial computing for different applications (WEF2022, chunk_66).\n\n### Data and Integration\nBDTs are concerned with managing a specific building structure (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_80). City-level twins, however, must manage inconsistent, multidimensional, and multiscale data from varied urban sources, including IoT and other sensing facilities (WEF2022, chunk_129). A key characteristic of a city digital twin is a two-way data flow between the physical and virtual entities (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68).

Most of the participants consider DT for cities as a living (digital/virtual) (representations/models) of the city existing real-world objects, infrastructures, systems, processes.

For example, a mobile user could use a DT to predict if a signal will be blocked or if they need to switch beams (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_19). The drawback of this approach is that decisions made solely based on the digital twin are very sensitive to the model's accuracy, which challenges the robustness of these decisions (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20). The overall usefulness and accuracy of a digital twin are dependent on its level of detail and the comprehensiveness of its data (White2021, chunk_07).\n\nThis trade-off is also evident in the scope of the digital twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_24). A partial digital twin generated from a local view has a limited scope for decision-making (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_24). In contrast, generating a more accurate digital twin that can handle advanced applications like future predictions requires a global overview of the environment (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_24). The distinction between \"High-Performance Real-Time (HPRT) DTs\" and \"Long-Term Decision Support (LTDS) DTs\" further highlights this division (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_05).\n\nTo resolve this tension, a concept called \"true digital twins\" has been proposed (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20). These systems are envisioned as machine learning models that continuously learn and improve their approximation of the physical world over time (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_21).

In some fields, the term digital twin is used interchangeably with concepts like 3D GIS or virtual city models, regardless of specific nuances (Lei2023, chunk_15). This has led to research that seeks to define the boundary by accumulating insights from existing literature and expert opinions (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_33) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_32).\n\n### The Role of Real-Time Data and Interaction\n\nA key differentiator is the connection to the physical world through real-time data and interaction (Jeddoub2023, chunk_34). Unlike a traditional simulation, a digital twin establishes \"simultaneous operation of and interaction between the physical and digital dimensions of the city\" (WEF2022, chunk_14). This capability for \"virtual-real interaction\" is considered a critical technical feature (WEF2022, chunk_14) (WEF2022, chunk_127).\n\nSpecific criteria for an urban digital twin include:\n*   Providing near real-time data (Lei2023, chunk_17).\n*   Being a dynamic representation that mirrors the states and behavior of its real-life counterpart across its lifecycle (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_91).\n*   Possessing the ability to self-iterate by detecting changes in the physical space (Lei2023, chunk_15).\n\nA model that is hosted online but lacks regular updates reflecting changes in the real world does not meet the criteria for a digital twin (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_91).\n\n### A Hierarchy of Digital Models\n\nSome sources define the boundary by classifying digital representations into a hierarchy of maturity (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15). This classification includes:\n1.  **Digital models:** Where there is only manual data transfer between the physical and digital objects (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n2.  **Digital shadows:** These incorporate automated real-time data input but still rely on manual interpretation (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n3.  **Autonomous digital twins:** In this highest form, the physical and digital objects are causally connected and synchronized through autonomous dataflows (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n\nSome experts argue that a system cannot be considered a true digital twin without nearly autonomous real-time synchronization (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n\n### Function Beyond Visualization\n\nA digital twin's purpose extends beyond the 3D visualization found in many traditional models (Lei2023, chunk_17) (Jeddoub2023, chunk_34). Focusing too heavily on high-precision visual reproduction while ignoring the ultimate value of simulation and reality optimization can lead to an unbalanced use of the technology (WEF2022, chunk_127). A true digital twin should enable a variety of operations, such as analyzing, simulating, predicting, and controlling the physical asset (Lei2023, chunk_17) (WEF2022, chunk_14).

For instance, an analysis of cell phone tower data showed that only four random spatio-temporal points are needed to uniquely identify 95% of individuals (Alessandretti2022, chunk_24). Such insights have profound legal and ethical consequences for sharing and tracking data (Alessandretti2022, chunk_24). The predictability of human movement patterns is a key element in these privacy considerations (Alessandretti2022, chunk_17).\n\nThe sensitivity of the data being collected is another major issue, especially when it is human-related (Lei2023, chunk_75). The use of high-resolution images, while useful for extracting detailed information, also creates concerns about sensitive exposure (Lei2023, chunk_75). Furthermore, the use of advanced and granular sensing technology may intensify these data privacy concerns (Wu2024, chunk_41).\n\nThese issues create significant challenges for the implementation and acceptance of urban digital twins (UDTs) (Mazzetto2024, chunk_115). Digital twin cities manage a high concentration of data, which presents challenges for data security and personal privacy protection (WEF2022, chunk_94). Data privacy is considered a hurdle to the widespread adoption of digital twins in urban life (Mazzetto2024, chunk_123). Case studies of real-world implementations, such as in Dubai, highlight the challenges of ensuring data security and privacy when deploying UDTs (Mazzetto2024, chunk_115).\n\nTo address these risks, there is a recognized need for governance frameworks that focus on ethical standards, data protection, and privacy to build public trust (Mazzetto2024, chunk_72). Some stakeholders express caution and have concerns about the ethics of using this data for decision-making (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_78).

Visualization is considered a critically important aspect of digital twin implementation, particularly in domains like building management (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_70).\n\nSeveral specific techniques and tools are used to visualize data in digital twins and their dashboards:\n*   **3D Models and Rendering**: Digital twins use 3D models with textures and materials that can be rendered and visualized in software like Lumion (Luo2024, chunk_38). Visualization engines like Unity 3D are also used to create immersive representations (Luo2025, chunk_40). Some cities focus on the fine reproduction of urban details using high-precision visual modelling technology (WEF2022, chunk_127). Dashboards can be built on 3D experience platforms, such as the one from Dassault Systèmes (WEF2022, chunk_63). Other advanced visualization techniques include photo-realistic rendering (Luo2024, chunk_34) and real-time ray tracing (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09).\n*   **Geospatial and Map-Based Visualization**: Digital twins are often constructed based on precise, real-time 3D maps (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_09). Geospatial analytics platforms like ArcGIS are used for spatial data integration (Luo2025, chunk_40).

This is crucial as integrating models, such as 3D buildings with terrain, can lead to errors that affect analysis and produce incorrect conclusions (Lei2023, chunk_39). One approach to ensure data integrity is to use data security standards to verify the authenticity of digital twin data (Wu2024, chunk_58).\n\nFor information extracted from multiple sources, a cross-validation and refinement mechanism can be used to enhance reliability (Lou2025, chunk_08). One such method employs a multi-agent system where different subagents perform specialized roles (Lou2025, chunk_14). In this system, an \"Extractor\" subagent generates output variants, an \"Evaluator\" subagent compares them, and if conflicts arise, a \"Refiner\" subagent selectively re-extracts the conflicting information (Lou2025, chunk_14). This \"dual-variant and conflict-repair mechanism\" aims to produce consistent and reliable information (Lou2025, chunk_14).\n\n### System and Asset Validation\nIn the context of Digital Twin (DT) platforms, validation is required for system configurations (Talasila2023, chunk_33). A \"sanity check\" or \"validity check\" should be performed on any given configuration, especially before a new configuration is implemented (Talasila2023, chunk_23).\n\nFurthermore, DT platforms that host reusable assets must be able to verify the promised functionality of those assets (Talasila2023, chunk_14). To achieve this, DevOps practices like continuous integration can be used for the verification of published assets (Talasila2023, chunk_14).\n\n### Performance and Model Assessment\nTo assess the performance of algorithms, one strategy is to evaluate their accuracy relative to full-case results and their runtime (DoBui2025, chunk_47). A quantitative metric, the Normalized Euclidean Distance (NED), can be used to measure deviations from a reference solution, providing a standardized measure of accuracy (DoBui2025, chunk_47).\n\nOther evaluation frameworks include assessing the technological and societal readiness levels of Urban Digital Twins (UDTs), though these measures can be qualitative and subjective (Wu2024, chunk_58).

A digital twin is a real-time, virtual replica of a physical system that is created using sensors (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_46).\n\nThe integration process begins with data acquisition from the physical environment (Lei2023, chunk_73). Devices equipped with one or more sensors collect local sensing information (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). For complex systems like cities, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are a key component (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_96). This data collection relies on the construction of physical hardware, such as a well-structured and connected network of urban sensors (Lei2023, chunk_73). In some applications, data can be collected from sensors without needing to be physically connected to them, which allows for monitoring during operation (Barbie2023a, chunk_51).\n\nOnce collected, the sensor data must be transferred and processed to update the twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). To generate an accurate, low-latency digital twin, sensing data gathered from various devices may be transferred quickly to a central unit for processing (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). The speed of this data transfer is dependent on the communication system's available bandwidth (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). An alternative approach is to process the limited sensing information locally on the device or at the edge, which can reduce processing and decision-making latency (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). The acquired local data can then be projected onto a 3D map to create the real-time digital twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). This integration of real-time data allows the digital model to update and change in sync with its physical equivalent (White2021, chunk_06).\n\nHowever, challenges in this process exist (WEF2022, chunk_129).

This process supports the synchronization between the physical object and the digital twin (Barbie2023a, chunk_09).\n\nWhile other specific architectures are not named, the evidence describes the key components and requirements that influence the architectural design of a digital twin's data pipeline. A complete digital twin system includes infrastructure, connectivity networks, platforms, applications, and data management standards (WEF2022, chunk_151). The pipeline must be designed to support an efficient update process that aligns the digital model with changes in the physical world (Lei2023, chunk_80).

INTRODUCTION Digital Twins (DTs) are used to add value to systems of interest which typically are called Physical Twins (PTs). Such DTs can be assisting individual Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in different ways and it is the vision of these capabilities that makes DTs so interesting. At the heart of a DT is a collection of models describing characteristics of the CPS of interest.

The concept of a \"system of systems\" is a building block for an Urban Digital Twin, which merges several twins into a unified urban information model (Jeddoub2023, chunk_48). In contrast, building-level digital twins focus on a single physical entity (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_12). Some interpretations of a \"City Digital Twin\" describe it as a static replica of the city that primarily focuses on an aggregation of buildings (Jeddoub2023, chunk_46).\n\n**Architectural Frameworks and Components**\nThe architectural components described for each level differ in complexity and scope (WEF2022, chunk_53) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n*   **Building-level:** The key components for building and architectural digital twins include 2D/3D data, data representation, and validation (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n*   **City-level:** A proposed framework for digital twin cities is more comprehensive, consisting of a \"4+5\" structure (WEF2022, chunk_53). This includes four core elements: infrastructure, data resources, platform capacity, and application scenarios (WEF2022, chunk_53). It also incorporates five external elements: strategy and mechanisms, stakeholders, funding, standards, and cybersecurity (WEF2022, chunk_53).\n\n**Purpose and Context**\nThe purpose of a digital twin varies significantly with scale (WEF2022, chunk_13) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n*   **Building-level:** Architectural and building digital twins are focused on long-term planning, decision support, accurate modeling, managing structures, and ensuring long-term operational efficiency (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n*   **City-level:** The goal of a digital twin city is to solve the complexity and uncertainty of broader urban systems, including planning, design, construction, management, and services (WEF2022, chunk_13). City-level twins, sometimes called Spatial or Geospatial Digital Twins, are used to provide a spatial context for the city's objects, infrastructures, and systems (Jeddoub2023, chunk_48).\n\nIt is important to note that the concept of digital twins for cities is still considered to be in a primary phase and can be ambiguous (WEF2022, chunk_13) (Jeddoub2023, chunk_02).

For example, a mobile user could use a digital twin to predict if their line-of-sight link will be blocked by a moving object or if they need to switch beams (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_19). This approach benefits from the rich environmental awareness of the digital twin to make efficient decisions (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20).\n\nOn the other hand, the drawback of this approach is that decisions based solely on the digital twin are very sensitive to the system's modeling accuracy (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20). The overall usefulness and accuracy of a digital twin depend on the level of detail put into it and how comprehensive the available data is (White2021, chunk_07). While an ideal digital twin would be identical to its physical counterpart with a complete, real-time dataset, this is difficult to achieve as system complexity increases (White2021, chunk_06) (White2021, chunk_07). This reliance on modeling accuracy challenges the robustness of decisions made in real-time (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20). For a digital twin to be reliable, its real-time computations must be \"sufficiently accurate\" to properly infer conditions in the physical world, such as communication channels (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_29).

While traditional simulations can model urban systems, a digital twin is defined by its ability to mirror and interact with the physical city in near real-time (WEF2022, chunk_14).\n\nKey distinctions highlighted in the evidence include:\n\n*   **Two-Way Data Flow**: A defining feature of a digital twin is the two-way data flow between the \"physical\" (P) and \"virtual\" (V) realms (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68). This interaction enables the simultaneous operation of both the physical and digital dimensions of the city (WEF2022, chunk_13) (WEF2022, chunk_14).\n*   **Real-Time Mirroring**: A digital twin is a \"living\" virtual representation that mirrors the states of a real-world urban area throughout its lifecycle (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_95). This mirroring is achieved by making full use of data from physical models, sensors, and operational history (WEF2022, chunk_25).

One approach is to leverage diverse data sources as a reference for cross-checking information, which helps in labeling high-quality data for training and validation (Cao2025, chunk_78). Another method uses a \"dual-variant and conflict-repair mechanism\" where an agent generates two independent outputs, an \"Evaluator\" agent compares them, and a \"Refiner\" agent re-extracts only the fields that are in conflict (Lou2025, chunk_14). This process of cross-validation and refinement during knowledge extraction can substantially improve credibility (Lou2025, chunk_08). The importance of such a mechanism is highlighted by the fact that removing a reliability module from a system leads to an increase in errors (Lou2025, chunk_25). The need for these strategies stems from the risk that biased or inconsistent information can cause errors and reduce the reliability of results (Lou2025, chunk_08).\n\n### Performance and Transferability Evaluation\n\nPerformance evaluation is a critical step for processes like urban mapping (Cao2025, chunk_60). However, evaluations often focus on accuracy within a single city or a few cities, which may not adequately reflect a model's transferability across different regions (Cao2025, chunk_80). It is recommended that validation also explicitly account for transferability, especially as multi-source data fusion methods can face challenges in this area (Cao2025, chunk_60) (Cao2025, chunk_80).\n\n### System and Source Validation\n\nValidation is also crucial at the system configuration level (Talasila2023, chunk_33). For instance, a system for creating and managing Digital Twins should support the validation of a given configuration (Talasila2023, chunk_33). In the context of research, validating the quality of source materials is also a recommended practice (Luo2025, chunk_24). One method for this is using a standard tool, such as the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist, to assess the rigor and reliability of studies being reviewed (Luo2025, chunk_24). These validation steps are important for maintaining data accuracy, as errors from integrating different data models can affect analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions (Lei2023, chunk_39).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Cao2025", "chunk_id": "chunk_78", "text": "quality, coverage, and granularity becomes pivotal.

The platform should provide capabilities like digital twin simulation and spatial computing (WEF2022, chunk_66).\n*   **Interaction and Visualization**: Components for visualization and virtual-real interaction are essential (WEF2022, chunk_151) (WEF2022, chunk_14). Interoperability is also a driving element (WEF2022, chunk_151).\n*   **Security**: Cybersecurity, security, and privacy are identified as key elements of a digital twin system (WEF2022, chunk_53) (WEF2022, chunk_151).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "WEF2022", "chunk_id": "chunk_28", "text": "of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics proposed the five-dimensional model, which embodies physical entities, virtual entities, service, twin data and connections.

This integration often involves an automatic data connection from the physical world to its digital copy, using near real-time data collected from sensors (Jeddoub2023, chunk_121). The updates are facilitated by sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_58). An example of this is NASA's use of real-time sensor telemetry to continuously monitor a system's \"health\" (Dawkins2025, chunk_15).\n\nA general framework for data integration involves three levels (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123):\n*   **Conceptual schema model level**: Data is integrated at the highest level of the digital twin, which can extend the model to cover new features and allow a direct feed into the database (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123).\n*   **Database level**: Data is integrated to feed or update specific attributes or classes, which may require a conversion process if the data is in various formats (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123).\n*   **Application level**: Data is integrated directly into the application, often at the viewer level (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123) (Jeddoub2023, chunk_124).\n\nTo manage this integration, specific standards and technologies are employed (Jeddoub2023, chunk_26).

Proposed solutions to manage the data flow include the use of edge and fog computing (Mazzetto2024, chunk_52).

This involves actively reflecting public feedback on digital models (Lei2023, chunk_81). For instance, feedback data from citizens can be used to determine the size and placement of offshore wind turbines (White2021, chunk_30). Simulations within the digital twin can also visualize the human impact of new developments, such as how a proposed skyscraper might block sunlight from existing parks (White2021, chunk_30). The overall objective is to use the technology to solve urban problems and plan more livable cities (Lei2023, chunk_22).\n\n**Stakeholder Collaboration:**\nDeveloping urban digital twins involves multiple groups with different backgrounds and viewpoints (Lei2023, chunk_08). A human-centered approach seeks to build consensus by identifying the interests of these various groups (Lei2023, chunk_81). Digital twins can serve as a tool to integrate the plans of different stakeholders into a single urban design (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95) and to help mediate spatial conflicts (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_95).\n\n**Accessibility and Usability:**\nTo encourage broader participation from key stakeholders and practitioners, there is a push to lower the technical threshold for using digital twin interfaces (WEF2022, chunk_141). Recommended practices include promoting open-source software and developing low-code or zero-code platforms (WEF2022, chunk_141). Providing API-enabled interfaces for inexperienced developers is another way to make the technology more accessible (WEF2022, chunk_141).

This enables the digital twin to continually adapt to operational changes based on collected online data and information (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_46).\n\nThe recalibration process involves several learning mechanisms and data sources:\n*   **Continuous Learning**: A digital twin is always learning and updating itself from multiple sources to represent the physical object in near real-time (White2021, chunk_12). The system can learn from itself, from other similar digital twins, from human experts, and from historical data (White2021, chunk_12).\n*   **Feedback Loops**: New information, such as public data from an open portal, creates a feedback loop that allows the model to evolve over time (White2021, chunk_34). This new data allows the digital twin to test its models and predictions against unseen information (White2021, chunk_34).\n*   **Self-Improving Models**: \"True digital twins\" are described as machine learning models themselves that perpetually learn and improve their approximation of the physical world (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_21). These advanced twins can use prior decisions and feedback to enhance modeling accuracy (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_21). The goal is for these twins to keep learning and improving over time, rather than just being used for initial training (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_17).\n\nIn some practical applications, however, incremental updates are not always used (Lei2023, chunk_49). For example, some cities tend to completely replace an old city model with a newer one (Lei2023, chunk_49).

HIL approaches are considered essential for validation when sensors and actuators are involved (Barbie2023a, chunk_06).

For instance, in the context of human mobility, entropy can be used to assess the predictability of sequences of locations (Alessandretti2022, chunk_17).

Evaluation standards for the acceptance, testing, and operation of each project are not uniform (WEF2022, chunk_92). However, the evidence details specific evaluation approaches within certain domains and methodologies for comparing the conceptual components of digital twins across sectors.\n\n### Evaluation in Urban and Communication Domains\n\nIn the urban domain, one evaluation methodology involves making empirical comparisons between Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) and traditional simulation methods (Mazzetto2024, chunk_82). This approach uses both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments (Mazzetto2024, chunk_82).\n*   **Quantitative metrics** include comparative performance, accuracy of results, computational efficiency, and the costs associated with implementation and maintenance (Mazzetto2024, chunk_82).\n*   **Qualitative assessment** evaluates the complexity and depth of insights that the digital twin can generate (Mazzetto2024, chunk_82).\n\nAnother evaluation method specific to an urban digital twin combines objective computer analysis with subjective human perception (Luo2024, chunk_67).\n*   **Objective analysis** uses computer vision algorithms for pixel-level semantic segmentation and quantifies spatial features such as the visual field area (Luo2024, chunk_67).\n*   **Subjective analysis** conducts immersive experiments to collect participants' visual perceptions, which are then compared with the objective analysis results (Luo2024, chunk_67).\n\nFor digital twins in communication systems, evaluation can be enabled through the use of combined datasets (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). A key consideration for evaluation in this domain is the trade-off between the amount of sensing data needed for an accurate digital twin and the available communication bandwidth to transfer that data quickly (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45).\n\n### Lack of Standardization and Future Development\n\nThere is currently no unified acceptance standard or operation evaluation system for digital twin cities (WEF2022, chunk_92). This absence of uniform evaluation standards creates risks and challenges for users when judging a project's completion and its effects (WEF2022, chunk_92). In response, standardization projects have been initiated by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and various technical committees in China (WEF2022, chunk_91).\n\n### Conceptual Evaluation Across Domains\n\nA different approach to evaluation involves analyzing the definitions and components of digital twins across domains like the Built Environment (Building and Urban) and Manufacturing (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_18). This analysis uses statistical methods like Chi-square tests (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_66) and standardized residuals to identify which digital twin components are over- or under-represented in different sectors (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_65).

{"run_id": "d56a059d-2144-42d5-bddb-613874bfbf38", "query": "How do participatory design approaches differ across reported digital twin implementations?", "answer": "Participatory design approaches in reported Urban Digital Twin (UDT) implementations differ significantly in their levels of engagement, the stakeholders involved, and their underlying design philosophies (Luo2025, chunk_10).\n\n### Levels of Participation\nReported UDT applications show a wide spectrum of public participation, ranging from passive informing to collaborative, group-based co-creation (Luo2025, chunk_61). Some implementations are limited to one-way information flows where static Web-GIS dashboards or 3D viewers are used to broadcast a plan and solicit only minimal feedback (Luo2025, chunk_61). In contrast, other models are designed to be open and publicly available, allowing users to actively interact with the model, provide feedback on urban planning, and tag local problems (White2021, chunk_10). This more active approach facilitates a process where citizens can share perceptual insights that planners can use to refine designs (Luo2025, chunk_21). However, a disconnect from established paradigms like Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) has been noted, highlighting a need to move from basic consultation to more genuine collaborative planning (Luo2025, chunk_69).\n\n### Stakeholder Involvement and Design Philosophy\nA key difference in approach is whether the design is user-centric or developer-driven (Lei2023, chunk_56). Many digital twins are constructed based on the interests of developers, which is not a user-centered design (Lei2023, chunk_56). This can lead to the exclusion of certain user types, such as non-experts and vulnerable groups (Lei2023, chunk_56).\n\nThe types of end-users also vary widely across different projects (Luo2025, chunk_51). Academics were featured as end-users in 47.6% of reviewed studies, often using UDTs as pedagogical or experimental tools (Luo2025, chunk_51). Government departments acted as end-users in 15.5% of studies, focusing on governance and resource allocation (Luo2025, chunk_51).

This contrasts with building-level twins, which are more focused on individual structures (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_80).\n\nThe scale of a city-level twin introduces significant data complexity. City digital twins must model and represent a wide array of \"real-world objects, infrastructures, systems, processes\" (Jeddoub2023, chunk_68). Their architecture often includes a central platform or \"core hub\" designed to aggregate \"multisource data\" from various infrastructures and city components (WEF2022, chunk_66). This can lead to challenges in managing \"multidimensional and multiscale data collection\" and ensuring consistent sensing capabilities across the urban environment (WEF2022, chunk_129).\n\nIn terms of core components and focus, Building Digital Twins (BDTs) emphasize accurate modeling and visualization to support building management, operations, and lifecycle management (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_80). Their key components include 2D/3D data, data representation, and visualization (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_80). Conversely, creating an urban digital twin is based on encoding the \"semantic and geospatial properties of city objects\" (Lei2023, chunk_04). The architecture often uses a Spatial Digital Twin to provide the necessary spatial context for the city's objects and infrastructure (Jeddoub2023, chunk_48).\n\nWhile they differ in scale and architecture, one noted similarity is that both building and urban digital twins do not necessarily demand the high-performance, real-time response required in other domains, such as manufacturing (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Abdelrahman2025", "chunk_id": "chunk_18", "text": "definitions.

While a digital twin's real-time nature allows it to benefit from an enriched awareness of its environment for quick decision-making, there is a significant drawback (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_19) (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20). Decisions based solely on the digital twin are very sensitive to the accuracy of its underlying model, which challenges the robustness of those decisions (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20).\n\nThis tension is further highlighted by several factors:\n*   **Scope vs. Speed**: A digital twin based on a limited, local view of an environment results in a \"partial digital twin\" (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_24). While this may support faster decision-making latency, its partial nature limits the scope of its capabilities (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_24). Advanced applications, such as predicting future blockages, require access to a more global and comprehensive real-time digital twin for accuracy (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_24).\n*   **Detail vs. Performance**: The accuracy and usefulness of a digital twin are dependent on the level of detail included and the comprehensiveness of the available data (White2021, chunk_07). A complex system may require a digital twin that is identical only in relevant areas and uses only the necessary real-time data to support simulations (White2021, chunk_07). Creating a comprehensive model with unparalleled accuracy and detail requires fusing sensing information from across different devices, which has increased computation, synchronization, and communication requirements (Mazzetto2024, chunk_11) (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_26).\n*   **System Categorization**: The distinction between different types of digital twins reflects this tension (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_05). Two major groups identified are High-Performance Real-Time (HPRT) DTs and Long-Term Decision Support (LTDS) DTs, suggesting a split between systems optimized for real-time responsiveness and those designed for other forms of decision support (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_05).\n\nTo resolve this trade-off, a concept called \"true digital twins\" has been proposed, which would function as machine learning models that continuously learn and adapt (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_20).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Alkhateeb2023", "chunk_id": "chunk_24", "text": "d decision-making latency.

While terms are sometimes used interchangeably, distinct characteristics separate the concepts (Lei2023, chunk_15) (Jeddoub2023, chunk_34).\n\nA key differentiator is the continuous, interactive data exchange (Jeddoub2023, chunk_15). A digital twin is a virtual representation that is updated via information exchange with the physical system, establishing interaction between the two (Jeddoub2023, chunk_15) (WEF2022, chunk_14). Consequently, a model that is not regularly updated to reflect real-world changes does not qualify as a digital twin (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_91). Some practitioners explicitly state that a 3D city model without \"automatic update procedures\" or one that is \"not reflecting real-time situation\" is not a digital twin (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_94). In this view, urban digital twins should provide near real-time data (Lei2023, chunk_17). However, there is some debate, as other analysis suggests that strict real-time updates may not be essential in the urban context, where development happens slowly (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_94).\n\nOne framework classifies digital representations into different types, helping to draw a boundary:\n*   **Digital models**: These have only a manual translation or interpretation between the physical and digital objects, which is characteristic of traditional simulations (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n*   **Digital shadows**: These systems use automated, real-time data input from the physical world but still rely on manual interpretation (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n*   **Autonomous digital twins**: These are defined by a causal connection and synchronization with the physical object through autonomous dataflows (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15). Some experts argue that this near-autonomous, real-time synchronization is a mandatory feature for any application to be considered a true digital twin (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_15).\n\nBeyond data connectivity, the intended function also defines the boundary (WEF2022, chunk_127). A digital twin must enable dynamic analysis that goes beyond simple 3D visualization (Lei2023, chunk_17). Its purpose is to support \"simulation extrapolation and virtual-real interaction capability,\" not just detailed visual reproduction (WEF2022, chunk_127).

However, the documents indicate that cost is a significant factor influenced by data processing and hardware requirements.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the overall cost of a digital twin:\n*   **Data Processing**: Processing massive amounts of data for simulation use cases can be difficult due to high costs and limited manpower (Lei2023, chunk_80). Transferring large quantities of redundant sensing data increases the computational cost overhead (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_47). One potential solution is for devices to use cooperative sensing protocols to transfer only the optimal amount of data required to generate an accurate digital twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_47).\n*   **Hardware**: Hardware presents a technical challenge for urban digital twins (Lei2023, chunk_37) (Lei2023, chunk_80). The scale of a project can be constrained by the cost of collecting and verifying urban data from multiple sources (Lou2025, chunk_19).\n*   **Cost Management**: Some models aim to reduce these costs; one framework for EV charging stations was able to minimize computational effort by over 80% (DoBui2025, chunk_76).
