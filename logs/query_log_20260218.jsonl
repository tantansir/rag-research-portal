More specifically, it is a spatial–temporal virtual representation of a real-world urban area that mirrors its states during its lifecycle, often through IoT sensors (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_95).\n\n**Key Characteristics and Functions**\nConceptually, an urban digital twin serves as a virtual ecosystem of the built environment (Lei2023, chunk_16). Its primary technical features include accurate mapping, analytical insight, virtual-real interaction, and intelligent intervention (WEF2022, chunk_14). These systems are designed to perform several functions:\n*   **Monitoring and Simulation:** They allow for the simulation, diagnosis, prediction, and control of urban systems (WEF2022, chunk_14). This includes determining the performance of different city systems (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_93).\n*   **Decision-Making:** UDTs are intended to aid policymakers in making better decisions by simulating different scenarios to save resources and reduce negative impacts on the physical environment (Lei2023, chunk_16). They aim to facilitate efficient urban production, liveable spaces, and sustainable environments (WEF2022, chunk_14).\n\n**Lack of Consensus and Terminology**\nDespite the growing literature, there is a lack of consensus regarding the specific terminology and definitions of UDTs (Wu2024, chunk_02). Experts have debated the following aspects:\n*   **Real-time Updates:** While some definitions emphasize real-time data updates, others suggest this may not be necessary given the slow pace of urban development (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_94).\n*   **Scope:** The term is sometimes used interchangeably with 3D GIS or virtual city models, though strict definitions require interaction and convergence between the physical and digital entities (Lei2023, chunk_15).\n*   **Nature of the Model:** Opinions vary on whether a UDT is a true replica of the real world or simply an advanced simulation model (Apeldoorn2025, chunk_54).

In the scope of urban planning, authorities have attached importance to applying digital twins in city planning and governance [33–36].

Individual devices equipped with sensors are expected to collect local sensing information (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). The construction of well-structured and connected sensor networks largely supports this data acquisition process (Lei2023, chunk_73).\n\n**Processing and Transmission**\nTo generate an accurate real-time digital twin with minimal latency, sensing data collected across devices often needs to be transferred to a central unit for processing (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). The rate of this data transfer depends on the available bandwidth of the communication system (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_45). Alternatively, a local approach allows sensing information to be processed directly on the device or edge to reduce decision-making latency (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23). The acquired local data can also be projected onto a 3D map to generate the real-time digital twin (Alkhateeb2023, chunk_23).\n\n**Adaptation and Updates**\nThe integration of this data allows the digital twin system to continually adapt to operational changes based on collected online information (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_46). By utilizing data analytics and machine learning, the digital twin can update and change dynamically as its physical equivalent changes (White2021, chunk_06).", "retrieved_chunks": [{"source_id": "Alkhateeb2023", "chunk_id": "chunk_45", "text": "y making them a digital twin of each other.

To manage this, platforms utilize specific standards to harmonize data streams:\n*   **FIWARE and NGSI-LD:** The FIWARE smart data model uses the NGSI-LD standard to unify sensor streams and integrate platforms under a common data format (Jeddoub2023, chunk_26). This model allows urban digital twins to represent reactive and predictive functionalities by modeling components as entities (Jeddoub2023, chunk_26).\n*   **CityGML and SensorThings:** The \"CityThings\" concept handles sensor data stored in separate databases by linking it to 3D city models using the SensorThings API and CityGML standards (Jeddoub2023, chunk_24). Additionally, CityGML 3.0 introduces the \"Dynamizer\" module to facilitate the integration of dynamic data into city models (Jeddoub2023, chunk_24).\n\n**Integration Architecture**\nData integration is structured across three distinct levels:\n1.  **Conceptual Schema Level:** Extending the top-level model to cover new features (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123).\n2.  **Database Level:** Feeding or updating specific attributes and classes, often requiring conversion processes for various formats (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123).\n3.  **Application Level:** Integrating data generally at the viewer level (Jeddoub2023, chunk_123).\n\n**Operational Implementation**\nIn practice, sensor data collected via telemetry is aggregated with external service data and physics simulations to compute the state of the twin (Barbie2023a, chunk_23). For software development, sensor interfaces can be integrated using emulators that replicate the exact input and output data packages of real hardware, allowing for valid digital shadows during testing (Barbie2023a, chunk_02).

The concept of digital twins from the manufacturing industry inspires the idea that the city can as well be mirrored in a virtual model [3–6]. Theoretically, creating an urban digital twin is based on encoding the semantic and geospatial properties of city objects [7,8]. Urban digital twins, as representations of physical assets in the cities, benefit multiple stakeholders in a variety of purposes. Since digital twins enable two-way interaction with real-world counterparts, analytical operations and simulations are feasible in the virtual urban environment [9]. For example, urban planners allow using digital twins to evaluate the impact of different scenarios in the cities, e. g. planned construction projects, disaster management [10].

In the scope of urban planning, authorities have attached importance to applying digital twins in city planning and governance [33–36].

Architectural digital twins specifically rely on 2D and 3D data, data representation, and validation to support long-term planning (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_81).\n\n**Operational Dynamics**\nTo distinguish a digital twin from a static model, the architecture must support a dynamic aspect that reflects real-world changes (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_90). While some experts argue that real-time data updates are essential, others suggest that real-time capabilities may not be strictly necessary for the urban domain given the slower pace of urban development (Abdelrahman2025, chunk_94).
