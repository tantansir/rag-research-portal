Ready availability of reusable models, data and tool assets, can help with creation and use of digital twins. A number of digital twin frameworks exist to facilitate creation and use of digital twins. In this paper we propose a digital twin framework to author digital twin assets, create digital twins from reusable assets and make the digital twins available as a service to other users. The proposed framework automates the management of reusable assets, storage, provision of compute infrastructure, communication and monitoring tasks. The users operate at the level of digital twins and delegate rest of the work to the digital twin as a service framework.",digital_twin; urban_ai,ArXiv paper on city digital twins and urban AI,data/raw/Talasila2023.pdf,data/processed/Talasila2023.txt

Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate multimodal inputs to address heterogeneous data in complex urban systems but often underperform on domain-specific tasks. Urban-MAS, an LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, is introduced for human-centered urban prediction under zero-shot settings. It includes three agent types: Predictive Factor Guidance Agents, which prioritize key predictive factors to guide knowledge extraction and enhance the effectiveness of compressed urban knowledge in LLMs; Reliable UrbanInfo Extraction Agents, which improve robustness by comparing multiple outputs, validating consistency, and re-extracting when conflicts occur; and Multi-UrbanInfo Inference Agents, which integrate extracted multi-source information across dimensions for prediction. Experiments on running-amount prediction and urban perception across Tokyo, Milan, and Seattle demonstrate that Urban-MAS substantially reduces errors compared to single-LLM baselines. Ablation studies indicate that Predictive Factor Guidance Agents are most critical for enhancing predictive performance, positioning Urban-MAS as a scalable paradigm for human-centered urban AI prediction.

Our review begins by providing a clear context for urban villages and elaborating the method for literature review, then summarizes the study areas, data sources, and approaches used for urban village mapping in China. We also address the challenges and future directions for further research. Through thorough investigation, we find that current studies only cover very limited study areas and periods and lack sufficient investigation into the scalability, transferability, and interpretability of identification approaches due to the challenges in concept fuzziness and variances, spatial heterogeneity and variances of urban villages, and data availability.

It can vary with urban features and the opportunities for human interactions, but it might also differ according to the underlying social conditions of city inhabitants across and within social surroundings. Such heterogeneity in how different demographic groups may experience cities has the potential to cause gender segregation because of differences in the preferences of inhabitants, their accessibility and opportunities, and large-scale mobility behaviours. However, traditional studies have failed to capture fully a high-frequency understanding of how urban vibrancy is linked to urban features, how this might differ for different genders, and how this might affect segregation in cities. Our results show that (1) there are differences between males and females in terms of urban vibrancy, (2) the differences relate to `Points of Interest` as well as transportation networks, and (3) that there are both positive and negative `spatial spillovers` existing across each city. To do this, we use a quantitative approach using Call Detail Record data--taking advantage of the near-ubiquitous use of mobile phones--to gain high-frequency observations of spatial behaviours across the seven most prominent cities of Italy. We use a spatial model comparison approach of the direct and `spillover` effects from urban features on male-female differences.

In this chapter, we identify and introduce two of them in details, i.e., information generation and information synthesis. Information generation allows AI to create tailored content addressing user needs directly, enhancing user experience with immediate, relevant outputs. Information synthesis leverages the ability of generative AI to integrate and reorganize existing information, providing grounded responses and mitigating issues like model hallucination, which is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring precision and external knowledge. This chapter delves into the foundational aspects of generative models, including architecture, scaling, and training, and discusses their applications in multi-modal scenarios. Additionally, it examines the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm and other methods for corpus modeling and understanding, demonstrating how generative AI can enhance information access systems.

The review organises the identified challenges across technical and non-technical dimensions. As the topic is novel, the corpus is rather small and lacking the contextualisation of challenges. Thus, we complement it with a survey based on the Delphi method, involving a diverse panel of domain experts covering academia, industry and government organisations. Combining the results, we identify 14 technical and 9 non-technical challenges and map them to phases of the digital twinâs life cycle.

However, there is a sheer volume of definitions and the terminological consensus remains out of reach. The lack of a universally accepted definition leads to ambiguities in their conceptualization and implementation, and may cause miscommunication for both researchers and practitioners. We employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to systematically extract and analyze definitions of DTs from a corpus of more than 15,000 full-text articles spanning diverse disciplines. The study compares these findings with insights from an expert survey that included 52 experts. The study identifies concurrence on the components that comprise a âDigital Twinâ?from a practical perspective across various domains, contrasting them with those that do not, to identify deviations. We investigate the evolution of digital twin definitions over time and across different scales, including manufacturing, building, and urban/geospatial perspectives. We extracted the main components of Digital Twins using Text Frequency Analysis and N-gram analysis. Subsequently, we identified components that appeared in the literature and conducted a Chi-square test to assess the significance of each component in different domains. Our analysis identified key components of digital twins and revealed significant variations in definitions based on application domains, such as manufacturing, building, and urban contexts. The analysis of DT components reveal two major groups of DT types: High-Performance Real-Time (HPRT) DTs, and Long-Term Decision Support (LTDS) DTs. Contrary to common assumptions, we found that components such as simulation, AI/ML, real-time capabilities, and bi-directional data flow are not yet fully mature in the digital twins of the built environment. We derived two definitions for the Building/Architecture DT and the City/Urban DTs. Both definitions have a must-have components (such as spatial and temporal data updates) and good-to-have components such as prediction, AI, bi-directional data flow, and Real-time data exchange. One of the key findings is that the definition of digital twins has not yet reached its equilibrium phase, highlighting the need for ongoing revisions as technologies emerge or existing ones become obsolete. To address this, we introduce a novel, reproducible methodology that enables researchers to refine and adapt the current definitions in response to technological advancements or deprecations.",digital_twin; definition,Relevant to urban digital twins and smart city research.,data/raw/What is a Digital Twin anyway.pdf,data/processed/Abdelrahman2025.txt

Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components.

An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning.

However, their potential in public engagement for environmental perception remains unfulfilled, with existing research lacking the capability to analyze urbanscapes' visual features and predict public perceptions based on photo-realistic renderings. To fill the gap, our study developed and implemented a UDT platform designed for the dual purposes of objective feature evaluation and subjective visual perception, alongside the prediction of perceptions in simulated scenarios. We incorporated DeepLabV3, a deep learning model for imagery semantic segmentation, to quantify a series of visual features within the built environment, such as the proportion of vegetation and architectural elements. Subjective visual perceptions (e.g. safety and lively) are captured using immersive virtual reality to gather public perceptions of different scenarios and learn patterns. Further, utilizing a photo-realistic rendering engine, high-quality renderings of textures and materials for UDT were achieved, and we proved their veracity based on a perception experiment. Afterwards, we employ the random forest algorithm for automated perception predictions of rendering scenarios. The implementation was demonstrated with a case study on an urban greenway in the central area of Singapore. We compared both the objective evaluation and subjective perception results, followed by a demonstration of automated visual perception prediction through photo-realistic scenario simulations, such as modifying vegetation density or introducing new architectural elé¢?ements to the skyline, to predict the perception of scenarios before they are built, leading to more efficient and automated urban planning.",urban; digital_twin; smart_city; human_centric; perception; urban_planning,Relevant to urban digital twins and smart city research.,data/raw/A perception-powered urban digital twin to support human-centered urban planning and sustainable city development.pdf,data/processed/Luo2024.txt
