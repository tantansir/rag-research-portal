The proliferation of UDTs draws heavily from advancements in smart city technologies, positioning UDTs as a cornerstone for in-depth analysis and modeling of urban physical systems (Figure 1). This integration is particularly impactful in the sphere of environmental sustainability, where UDTs, in conjunction with technologies like the Internet of Things (Io T), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data (BD), herald a new era for sustainable urban design and planning [1]. Since their introduction in the early 21 st century, DTs have seen a surge in adoption, facilitated by the swift integration of digital infrastructure and data-centric technologies within urban landscapes",
