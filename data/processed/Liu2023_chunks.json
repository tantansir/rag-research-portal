Introduction Cities are the systems of networks and flows (Batty, 2013) of which urban sidewalks are a crucial component (Hosseini, Miranda, Lin, & Silva, 2022; Ning, Ye, Chen, Liu, & Cao, 2022). Sidewalks function not only for transportation and everyday commute but also as a carrier for social interactions and recreational physical activities (Liu, Zhang, Jin, & Liu, 2020), i. e., walking, that promote active lifestyles (Kelly, Schootman, Baker, Barnidge, & Lemes, 2007). In the urban environment, increased walking activities benefit the city from various perspectives, from air pollution reduction to urban spaces safety maintenance; it is also an essential measure of the life quality of a community (Ataman & Tuncer, 2022; Bicycle, 2008; Blacklock, Rhodes, &",

Therefore, designing and maintaining sidewalks for pedestrians is one of the key focuses of urban planners to develop a healthier and happier city. In recent years, human perceptions have become a useful measurement to assess urban outdoor environment (Abdollahzadeh & Biloria, 2021; Bivina & Parida, 2022; Deng et al., 2021; Florio et al., 2021; ∗ Corresponding author at: Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

During the walking activity on the sidewalks, people perceive multisensory experiences (e. g., thermal experience, surrounding traffics) interacting with a series of urban spatial objects (e. g., buildings, trees, roadconditions)thatimpacttheirstateofcomfortwhennavigatingand path-finding in the urban realm (Gao et al., 2022). Previous research primarily focused on the thermal experiences (i. e., thermal comfort) of the pedestrians, which are essential to understanding the relationship between urban micro-climate and spatial urban morphology (Nice et al., 2022; Vasilikou & Nikolopoulou, 2020) and also as an indicator of the sidewalk quality (Abdollahzadeh & Bilori",

However, thermal comfort measures do not capture a complete comprehension of the walking experience in the environment, particularly in the outdoor settings where the inter-play between pedestrians and spatial objects along the walking is constantly changing (Bivina & Parida, 2022). The sense of the crowdedness of the road, safety, fear or willingness to walk in the sun, the slope condition of the roads, and other facets can heavily affect human comfort when walking on the routes (Guan et al., 2022; Meng & Kang, 2016; Miranda, Fan, Duarte, & Ratti, 2021; Natapov https://doi. org/10.1016/j. scs.2023.104480 Received 30 December 2022; Accepted 8 February 2023\n\nSustainable Citiesand So",

In the studies of urban sidewalks, previous research shows that personal experience of the urban continuum is perceived in a dynamic nature (Potvin, 2000). The sequential manner of pedestrians experiencing the interconnected urban spaces reinforces such a dynamic perceptual mode through the actual movement between spaces (Vasilikou & Nikolopoulou, 2020), as shown in Fig. 1.

Predicting human comfort Although, in this paper, our research objective is to predict human comfort when walking on outdoor sidewalks, the initial idea was inspired by an indoor thermal comfort study.

Each cell is connected to the building object’s nodes (e. g., walls, windows, doors) in the graph structure when the cell is within the building objects’ area of influence (Ao I, e. g., fan radius). For a person in the building, the location of the cells also represents where the person is.

However, three primary deficiencies of the model inhibit its direct employment in our study. First, the outdoor surroundings are much more complicated than the indoor environment.

Fourth, driven by the goal of AI for social good (Tomašev et al., 2020), we will use this model to study sidewalk walkabilities at an urban scale with more participants and scenarios. We hope to integrate such a model in the DT platform to achieve a near real-time comfort prediction to support downstream applications, such as human-oriented comfort-driven navigation.

In summary, this paper introduced a spatio-temporal-explicit Geo AI model to predict outdoor human comforts using crowdsourced data and dynamic graphs.
