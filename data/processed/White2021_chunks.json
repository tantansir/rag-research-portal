Introduction Cities have become increasing smarter in the last two decades (Albino et al., 2013), using pervasive information and communications technology (ICT) to monitor activities in the city (Neirotti et al., 2014). Data can then be generated from a wide variety of activities in the city, such as traffic and transportation (Menouar et al., 2017), power generation (Oldenbroek et al., 2017), utilities provisioning (S´anchez et al., 2013), water supply (Parra et al., 20",

Smart cities can then use this data to improve the mobility, environment, living standards and governance of the city (Abella et al., 2017; Angelidou, 2015). A strong link has been shown between investing in smart city policies and urban GDP growth (Caragliu & Del Bo, 2019). The data generated by smart cities makes them exciting testbeds for data mining and machine learning (Mohammadi & Al-Fuqaha, 2018; White & Clarke, 2020).

The system can learn from itself, from other similar digital twins or from human experts with relevant domain knowledge.

Further experimentation can evaluate how individual street furniture (e. g., bins, lights, footpath width etc.,) effects the waiting time of pedestrian types as they move through the city. The results from these simulations can then be used to inform urban planning and policy. Fig. 13 shows the average distance that is travelled by the agent types. The elderly agents distance travelled remains quite constant. However, the adult distance travelled",

This indicates that the adult agents can use their increased speed to move around any elderly agents in the simulation or obstacles. This keeps their average waiting time low as shown in Fig. 12, even though the distance they travel increases with the percentage of elderly people. 6. Limitations of current digital twin In this section we identify some of the limitations of the current Digital Twin through the layers of the model outlined in Fig. 1.

Buildings The Docklands model includes a large area of Dublin, some of the modern buildings along the waterfront are captured in great detail. However, there are some areas in the model, especially of older buildings and open spaces, such as the Bus Depot in Fig. 14 that are represented by grey boxes. Although the function of the grey box cannot be determined from the model it does not affect the functionality of the citizen feedback or crowd simulations. 6.2. Infrastructure The rail bridge near Samuel Beckett bridge is shown as seen in the physical world and in the digital twin in Fig. 15.

Fig. 15 b shows the right side of the bridge in the physical world and Fig. 15 d shows how this is represented in the digital twin. The digital twin is missing the small bridge as seen in Fig. 15 b to allow pedestrian access on this side of the bridge.

The digital twin can be used to engage citizens and get a lot of valuable feedback on key urban planning and policy decisions. The results of skyline and green space planning simulations have shown how user feedback and suggestions can be collected to provide additional data to inform urban planning and policy decisions to allow for additional changes before a final decision is made.

These problems or suggestions can then be sent to the relevant government department with the exact location of the problem. A digital twin can also be used for a range of other urban planning decisions and policy.
