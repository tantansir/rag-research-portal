The formation of urban villages in China is a complexity of rapid urbanization and unique institutional regulations. In China, the urban and rural areas and residents have been institutionally divided into two distinct groups, which is referred to as the urban-rural dual structure. In terms of property rights, urban villages have special legal form, as they fall outside urban administration, and building activities are managed by the village collective, which dictates how the land is transformed and utilized (Sa and Haila, 2023). This land management system leads to the formation of ‘islands’ or ‘vacuum’ within cities which lead to the high-de",

Despite the drawbacks, urban villages act as sanctuaries for a substantial number of migrant workers in cities.

Informal settlements grow as a consequence of cities, while urban villages existed before cities and have been engulfed in the spatial expansion process. Specifically, the formation of urban villages in China is a complexity resulting from the combination of the unique Chinese institutions and rapid urbanization (Tong et al, 2011).

Second, as urban villages formed as a consequence of rapid urbanization and unique institutional background, they usually concentrate in these dense urban areas.

This process usually begins with the division of spatial units to accommodate data with varying spatial resolutions.

The validation of model outcomes is crucial in this setting, as inaccuracies can lead to misrepresentation of communities, potentially affecting urban planning and policy decisions. Fieldwork, although challenging, becomes indispensable for validating the results obtained through remote sensing and AI models. Initiating a 21\n\ncrowdsourcing progra",

Initiating a 21\n\ncrowdsourcing program to enable effective and efficient data collection and validation can be a promising direction. Moreover, the uncertainties and interpretation of models also pose a particular challenge in the context of urban village mapping. Urban villages are complex socio-economic entities, and their representation through models requires careful consideration of various factors and indicators. Communicating these model results to end-users or stakeholders, including urban planners, local governments, and the residents of the urban villages themselves, is vital. On the other hand, the opportunities provided by recent advancements in cloud computing, deep learning, geospatial processing software, and exp",

These technological advancements can help in accurately identifying and delineating urban village boundaries, understanding their spatial patterns, and monitoring their change over time. The success of large-area urban village mapping projects depends not only on the accuracy of the maps produced but also on how these maps are used to inform urban development and improve the lives of urban village residents.

Despite the significance of studying urban villages, there are scarce spatial urban village data available. Thus, it is of high importance for urban village mapping. To investigate the latest progress made in urban village mapping and point out challenges and future directions, we make a comprehensive review, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in this field. Our thorough investigation reveals that current studies on urban village mapping are limited in terms of study areas and periods, and they insufficiently address the scalability, transferability",

This shortfall arises from challenges such as concept fuzziness, spatial heterogeneity, and data availability. To advance research and facilitate large-area urban village mapping nationwide, future efforts can focus on the following potential directions: 1) establishing a unified standard for urban villages in China to accommodate significant variances and fuzzy concepts; 2) tackling data availability challenges by flexibly utilizing available multisource data and exploring the potential of data-driven image super-resolution techniques; 3) creating public benchmarks to ensure fair comparisons while emphasizing the scalability, transferabil",
