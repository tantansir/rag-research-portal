UDT studies primarily focus on visual and functional perception, with limited attention to auditory and risk perception dimensions.

Introduction The accelerating process of global urbanization has led to increasingly complex urban environments and a growing array of challenges, placing growing demands on contemporary urban planning and governance (Wang et al., 2023 a; Ajjur and Al-Ghamdi, 2022). Understanding how people perceive the built environment and how they participate in decision-making has therefore become critical (Wu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023 a). Traditional urban planning methods, such as static surveys and isolated consultations, often fail to capture dynamic public feedback, leading to outcomes that do not fully meet societal needs (Luo et al., 2025 b; Liu et al., 2023).

The role of urban digital twins in citizen-centric planning UDTs, as dynamic digital replicas of physical cities, are increasingly central to smart city initiatives worldwide (Tzachor et al., 2022; Weil et al., 2023).

These platforms typically integrate high-fidelity 3D models with multi-source data streams from Io T sensors and geospatial databases, turning continuous monitoring into actionable urban intelligence (Xu et al., 2022; Adade and de Vries, 2023).

Crucially for citizen-centric planning, UDTs offer powerful tools for assessing built environments and facilitating public engagement across the entire planning lifecycle (Ferré-Bigorra et al., 2022). For this review, we adopt a widely accepted definition: a UDT is a dynamic digital representation of the physical urban environment, integrating multi-source data and advanced technologies to simulate, monitor, and enhance urban systems in (near)-real-time (Haraguchi et al., 2024",

The perception-powered urban studies Building on environmental psychology, built environment perception refers to how individuals and groups interpret and respond to their surroundings. It is a cognitive-affective appraisal of urban space encompassing sensory, psychological, and behavioural dimensions such as visual quality, perceived safety, accessibility, and social ambience (Zhou and Tan, 2024; Luo et al., 2022 b; Wang et al., 2019).

Foundational works, such as Lynch’s The Image of the City (Lynch, 1964), highlighted the importance of visual coherence, spatial organization, and functional elements in shaping urban perception (Filomena et al., 2019), while subsequent studies link built environment perception to safety, comfort and social interaction that shape mobility and place attachment (Zhang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2023). Understanding these perceptions is critical because they directly inform urban design and policy (Liu et al., 2023). Frameworks from environmental psychology, cognitive science and landscape architecture all stress its multidimensional nature: visual appeal, social dynamics, functional convenience, and perceived risk (Gifford, 2014; Taupin et al., 2023).

Conversely, negative perceptions signal environmental stress and guide targeted interventions (Stanislav and Chin, 2019). As cities evolve, the role of built environment perception in urban planning has become increasingly significant (Jo and Jeon, 2020). Perception-oriented planning leverages the concept of ’humans as sensors,’ recognizing that citizens’ lived experiences provide significant insights into the functionality and quality of urban spaces (Liu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023).

This approach strengthens the connection between people and their environment and allows planners to identify sources of stress, such as poorly designed areas, to enable targeted interventions (Luo et al., 2022 a; White et al., 2021). UDTs provide an innovative pathway to operationalize these ideas. By coupling realtime data with immersive 3D visualization, they allow stakeholders to evaluate how design changes, such as new street layouts, might impact user experiences, including pedestrian comfort and perceived safety (Ferré-Bigorra et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2025 a).

As highlighted by Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation (Arnstein, 1969), public involvement varies in form and degree but plays a central role in achieving democratic and inclusive planning.

Consequently, effective participation is considered a cornerstone of contemporary urban planning, enhancing the legitimacy and feasibility of planning outcomes by aligning them with community aspirations (Bryson et al., 2013; Fung, 2015). However, traditional methods of public participation, such as public hearings and surveys, face notable limitations. These approaches often provide limited engagement opportunities, struggle to attract broad and representative participation, and suffer from asymmetric information, where citizens lack access to comprehensive planning data (Akmentina, 2023; Kingston, 2007).

Spatial openness pertains to the perceived spaciousness and openness of urban spaces, typically assessed through indicators such as sky-view factors, street width-to-building height ratios, and the presence of unobstructed views (Liu et al., 2023). Visual appeal encompasses broader visual satisfaction derived from urban environments, combining aesthetic beauty with factors such as greenery, landmark visibility, and overall spatial coherence (Jaalama et al., 2022).

These fields have a long history of developing tools and methodologies that empower large, diverse communities to contribute geospatial data and local knowledge, fostering a more democratic form of data co-creation (Haklay, 2012; Luo et al., 2025 a).

On the other hand, this reliance on sophisticated technology raises critical equity concerns.
