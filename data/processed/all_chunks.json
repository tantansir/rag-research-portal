INTRODUCTION Digital Twins (DTs) are used to add value to systems of interest which typically are called Physical Twins (PTs). Such DTs can be assisting individual Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in different ways and it is the vision of these capabilities that makes DTs so interesting. At the heart of a DT is a collection of models describing characteristics of the CPS of interest. In practice, a comprehensive DT may marshal a collection of diverse models, each developed for different purposes. These models are evaluated on tools using the data received from PT.

This is a significant research and implementation challenge, mostly because the domain is fuzzy and expanding so fast, that applying DSLs would be a moving target. There is a need to define a new DSL, or at least repurpose existing DSL to enforce the semantic restrictions on DT configuration. A more complex problem of configuration optimization awaits the researchers intending to scale up DT deployments in a cost-efficient manner. Second, we would like the DT platform tool to follow the DT lifecycle. In the beginning, the DT features provided are more or less standard, and focus is on those services that are application agnostic.

Then, as the user of the DT learns more about the PT (through visualisation and basic historical simulation support), (s)he can develop basic state estimation algorithms that use simulation on historical data, such as the one introduced in [24]. Then we can introduce more advanced state estimation algorithm such as the Kalman filtering, but these require slightly different models provided by the user. This introduces the challenge of keeping models consistent, since the models used for state estimation are similar to the models used for historical simulation, but have extra inputs.

Third, is the on-demand management of user workspaces which frees up the execution resources and accommodates more users on the platform. A natural next step in this direction is the separation of DT lifecycle management from the user workspace. One user can create a DT, hand over the same to another user who will manage the other lifecycle phases of the given DT. VII.

INTRODUCTION Heading towards 6G, communication systems are increasingly featuring key trends such as the employment of large numbers of antennas and the use of higher frequency bands [1]. These technology trends bring higher data-rate and multiplexing gains to the networks, but also impose critical challenges on the ability of these systems to support highly-mobile, energy-constrained, reliable, and low-latency applications. For example, the deployment of large antenna arrays is associated with high channel acquisition and beam sweeping overhead [2], [3], which makes it hard for these massive MIMO systems to support mobile applications, and the use of higher f",

The formation of urban villages in China is a complexity of rapid urbanization and unique institutional regulations. In China, the urban and rural areas and residents have been institutionally divided into two distinct groups, which is referred to as the urban-rural dual structure. In terms of property rights, urban villages have special legal form, as they fall outside urban administration, and building activities are managed by the village collective, which dictates how the land is transformed and utilized (Sa and Haila, 2023).

Despite the drawbacks, urban villages act as sanctuaries for a substantial number of migrant workers in cities.

Informal settlements grow as a consequence of cities, while urban villages existed before cities and have been engulfed in the spatial expansion process.

First, there is a general bias of urban studies to focus on large cities due to the significance of urban challenges as well as resources and policy inclination (Tjarks, 2024). Second, as urban villages formed as a consequence of rapid urbanization and unique institutional background, they usually concentrate in these dense urban areas.

Firstly, ambiguity in definition and context, as discussed in Section 6.1, can lead to the misuse of urban village maps across various domains.

Such heterogeneity in how different demographic groups may experience cities has the potential to cause gender segregation because of differences in the preferences of inhabitants, their accessibility and opportunities, and large-scale mobility behaviours. However, traditional studies have failed to capture fully a high-frequency understanding of how urban vibrancy is linked to urban features, how this might differ for different genders, and how this might affect segregation in cities.

This trend toward urban life is thought to be related to economic development alongside changes in social organisation [Harris, 1990, Bettencourt et al., 2007], how humans use land [Liu et al., 2020], and the drastic changes in the patterns of collective human behaviour [Thomas, 2008, Bettencourt et al",

It is also the case that the data were only derived from phone calls; this clearly misses a breadth of other communication methods and could potentially hide biases in the data due to the myriad of different ways people communicate today. Furthermore, gender information is derived from SIM purchases, but this is likely to not be an exact representation of the gender of users. However, we also note t",

However, we also note that our validation with the census data shows a good correlation with the mobile phone data, suggesting that these issues may be relatively limited (see Figure SI 5). A second potential problem is that the data are from differing time periods: we have taken census data from 2011, CDR data from 2015, and Open Street Map data from 2022. This undoubtedly introduces some biases in the analysis; however, we expect them to be small and not affect the overall results. In this study, we have considered the modelling of urban vibrancy with respect to gender differences. We found that the density of different collections of ‘Points of Interest‘ are simultaneously associated with both decreases and inc",

This was the case when we gave a broad-scale use-category (‘Points of Interest‘) and a fine-scale use-category that considers the social context of a place (third place). This adds further evidence for the importance of characterising third places when studying urban environments and urban vibrancy. This evidence also suggests that comparing different collections of ‘Points of Interest‘ could hold interesting avenues for further research relating to urban vibrancy. We have shown that this could also provide details on the potential segregation we find existing in cities today. To conclude, our analysis provides further evidence and support for the use of CD",

Hallucinating, which refers to the behavior of generative AI models that create responses and outputs that are not grounded by facts or existing supporting materials, is rooted in the foundation of most existing generative AI systems.

Overall, research on how generative AI models could reshape modern information access systems is still at an early stage today. As discussed above, existing studies on information generation and information synthesis either focus on simple information tasks (such as writing a poem, answering a factoid question, etc.) or reply on simple system design (e. g., feeding all documents to LLMs as prompts) that obviously cannot fully exploit the power of modern retrieval and generation models. Therefore, we believe that there are two major directions worth exploring in the next couple of years (at least). The first one is to move from simple and unit information retrieval tasks (e. g., factoid QA) to mo",

Examples include retrieval with composite needs (e. g., ”help me plan a wedding in Amherst, MA”) or tasks that requires planning and multiple rounds of retrieval and generations (e. g., ”write a survey on RAG”). These tasks used to require human experts to decompose the needs and conduct retrieval, analysis, and result aggregations. With the help of generative AI, accomplishing them automatically with machines is now possible. The second direction is to explore better techniques to communicate, collaborate, or even unify retrieval and generation systems for information accessing. While the studies of RAG hav",

Interestingly, in simulated social experiments on human-AI competitions, Yao et al. [153] find that, if human producers don’t extend their capacities with the help of generative AI, they will eventually be “replaced” by AI. From this perspective, the future of IR research in the era of generative AI lies in how to extend the scope of IR with generative AI models to finish more complicated information tasks and develop more general system architectures that not just re",

The proliferation of UDTs draws heavily from advancements in smart city technologies, positioning UDTs as a cornerstone for in-depth analysis and modeling of urban physical systems (Figure 1). This integration is particularly impactful in the sphere of environmental sustainability, where UDTs, in conjunction with technologies like the Internet of Things (Io T), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data (BD), herald a new era for sustainable urban design and planning [1]. Since their introduction in the early 21 st century, DTs have seen a surge in adoption, facilitated by the swift integration of digital infrastructure and data-centric technologies within urban landscapes",

From the analysis of the definitions in collected papers, we found that UDTs are conceptually similar to Digital Twins (DTs), sharing simulation as one of the primary functions and featuring real-time links between the physical and digital realms. However, UDTs’ definitions distinguish themselves by highlighting human elements, emphasizing usability, and mentioning adaptive complex systems, reflecting urban environments’ dynamic nature (Charitonidou 2022; Lei et al. 2023; Mohammadi and Taylor 2021; B.

The data-source approach refers to sensors and Internet of Things (Io T) technology that track the physical components of the city infrastructure or the integration of building information models (BIM) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (Ivanov et al. 2020; Ketzler et al. 2020; Visconti et al. 2021).

Detailed discussions of how we analyze definitions and architectures are provided in Appendix B. Scholarly debates on UDTs concentrate on two questions. The first pertains to the required levels of fidelity and synchronicity. The common opinion is that achieving perfect fidelity and synchronicity is neither feasible nor necessary for most applications (Batty 2018; Fotheringham 2024; Tomko and Winter 2018). Instead, the demand for these features and the thresholds that define a UDT should be contingent upon use cases. The second debate revolves around the necessity of data linkage.",

While most scholars believe bi-directional data linkage is theoretically crucial, its practical implementation is often limited, typically requiring human-in-the-loop (Batty 2018; Saeed et al. 2022; Visconti et al. 2021). These discussions highlight the need for flexibility and pragmatism in defining UDTs in various urban contexts. To align with existing literature and anticipate the needs of future studies, we operationalize the definition of UDTs as the digital representations of cities that possess the necessary level of fidelity, synchronicity, comprehensiveness, and interactivity to perform the functions they are designed for.

Typology: What Are the Different Categories of UDTs? Several typologies of UDT exist in the literature, such as classification by business models, design philosophies, and other thematic angles (Al-Sehrawy, Kumar, and Watson 2023; D’Hauwers, Walravens, and Ballon 2021). Yet, the most prevalent classifications are based on integration and maturity levels. The integration level typology examines the presence of bi-directional data linkages",

These common typologies align with the central debates in UDT definitions and emphasize the inherent nature of UDTs as digital twins.

Early Efforts in Standardization A key area in standardization is to improve the interoperability of data formats and models. One of the mainstream data formats for UDT is City GML. Initially designed for 3D city modeling, it has increasingly been enriched with geospatial attributes and semantic data (Beil et al. 2020; Lei, Stouffs, and Biljecki 2022; Visconti et al. 2021; Yan et al. 2022).

Research on emerging AI technologies with potential applications in UDTs. Appendix B Detailed Methods for Analyzing UDT Definitions and Architectures We identified a set of 12 explicit definitions of Urban Digital Twins (UDT) and conducted a comparative analysis to identify commonalities and differences between UDT and generic Digital Twin (DT) definitions as well as shared features within UDT definitions. Our methodology involved utilizing a keyword freq",

Our methodology involved utilizing a keyword frequency analysis derived from Sepasgozar (2021) to identify key terms recurring in generic DT definitions such as “real-time,” “simulation,” “control,” and “bi-directional.” Notably, the concept of “simulation” is in nearly all UDT definitions, with approximately half incorporating the notions of “real-time” or “near-real-time.” Conversely, references to “control” and “bi-directional” attributes are less common in UDT definitions. What is unique to UDT definitions is the emphasis on “human elements” such as “urban occupants” and “social and economic functions,” and “usability” aspects like “cooperation and accessibility” and “user-friendly” interfaces (Alva, Biljecki, and Stouffs 2022; Lei et",

In addition, a subset of papers suggested that UDTs are adaptive complex systems comprising interconnected sub DTs, although most stopped at theoretical discussion and do not have real-world implementations (Caldarelli et al. 2023; Ivanov et al. 2020; Mylonas et al. 2021; Taylor, Bennett, and Mohammadi 2021). We also reviewed 21 UDT architecture diagrams from our collected literature, which provide a visual understanding of UDT functionality and operational emphasis. These diagrams predominantly illustrate data and information flow, with about half depicting the bi-directional exchange between the physical and virtual realms, often represen",

However, merely four of these diagrams explicitly describe the bi-directional interaction process. For instance, Castelli et al. (2019) describe the link as a process that enhances policy-making through collaborative, crossdisciplinary feedback. In addition, our analysis found that nearly half of the UDT architectures use a layered approach, typically comprising layers for data collection, data processing, application, and occasionally human-computer interaction. This structure is reminiscent of smart city architectures, where various urban components, including the digital twin layer, are organized hierarchically (Dani et al. 2023).

The most severe challenges appear to be related to interoperability (e. g. disparate semantic standards) and practical value (e. g. lack of business models). 1.

Theoretically, creating an urban digital twin is based on encoding the semantic and geospatial properties of city objects [7,8]. Urban digital twins, as representations of physical assets in the cities, benefit multiple stakeholders in a variety of purposes. Since digital twins enable two-way interaction with real-world counterparts, analytical operations and simulations are feasible in the virtual urban environment [9]. For example, urban planners allow using digital twins to evaluate the impact of different scenarios in the cities, e. g. planned construction projects, disaster management [10].

Since research on digital twins is rather in its infancy, the present discourse is predominantly technology-driven. The role of urban digital twins is highlighted as an integrated and promising approach to data-based infrastructure management and urban sustainability endeavours [15]. Such work based on digital twins relies on the support of a variety of technologies, including the Internet of Things (Io T), artificial intelligence (AI), and edge computing, to collect and process data [16,17].

Specific challenges may be highlighted, while at the same time some aspects may be neglected. For example, some digital twins are developed as an internal platform to which the public has no access.

A consensus of digital twins The concept of digital twins is initially proposed as a virtual model of a physical product in manufacturing [23,24]. It indicates the process of mirroring or twinning with binary information flow between these two entities, enabling specific operations, e. g. testing, optimising and simulating [25]. One of the most popular definitions is from the field of aerospace — it describes the digital twin as an integrated multi-scale simulation of the physical entity to mirror the life of its corresponding twin [26]. Researchers from other domains often adopt this definition and expand it with detailed properties. For example, the digital twin should self-iterate through change detection in physical spa",

For example, the digital twin should self-iterate through change detection in physical space, contain interaction and convergence between two entities, and make predictions [27,28]. There has been a significant increase in publications on digital twins in the urban context since 2016, mainly concerning technologies and potential [18,29]. In related fields, such as 3D GIS, built environment, or virtual city models, the term digital twin is often used interchangeably regardless of nuances in specific contexts [30,31]. In the built environment, the Gemini principles developed by the Centre for Digital Built Britain in 2018 have sought to build consensus between each single digital twin [32].

Moreover, digital twins need to be purposeful, trustworthy and functional, which have advantage in adding value to public services and maintaining assets in the built environment. In the scope of urban planning, authorities have attached importance to applying digital twins in city planning and governance [33–36]. As such, policymakers can simulate different scenarios in the virtual model to reduce negative impacts on the physical environment, save resources, and then make better decisions [8,20].

Apart from data issues, ‘system architecture’ also presents impact on processing data in the survey responses. It indicates a need",

Such ambiguity will pose problems when practitioners start a practical project on urban digital twins without a consensus on what a digital twin should be.

As our study highlights the most documented DTs initiatives for cities according to 9 comprehensive categories, a new approach assessing the initiatives is proposed to evaluate the data integration methods used in the current realizations. Three levels are suggested: a conceptual schema model-based level (the data are integrated into the top level of the DT, i. e., extending the schema model to cover new features or themes); a databasebased level (data are integrated in order to feed or update specific attributes or classes); and an application-based level (the data are integrated into the application generally at the viewer level). 1.

Introduction Digital Twins (DTs) lie unanimously to three major components: a physical (entity, system, process), its digital representation and seamless data connections that bind the digital and real counterparts together (Grieves, 2016; Van Der Horn and Mahadevan, 2021). While the concept of a DT is a quite old term in several industries (Ammar et al., 2022; Mylonas et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2019; Xiong and Wang, 2022), it is starting to gain a significant interest in the urban and geospatial context from 2016 and onward (Ketzler et al. 2020; Stoter et al. 2021).

DTs for cities come from the willingness of the Smart Cities (SCs) initiatives to introduce digital technologies, to implicate various players (governments, private parties, citizens) and to generate insights for better decision-making through a range set of simulations and urban analysis.

Nevertheless, the process of replicating this concept of other industries in the urban environment is not straightforward due to the complexity, the spatial and temporal urban scale. Narrowing DTs for cities scope to the geospatial domain and the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) field, such cities complexities were already approached 20 years ago, namely with 3D City Models (3DCM) (Billen et al., 2014), Building Information Models (BIM) (Hagedorn, 2007), Virtual City Models (VCM) (Batty and Hudson-Smith, 20",

Another challenge that hinders the full deployment of DT for cities is the lack of a generic data integration framework (Shahat et al., 2021). It is important to highlight the motivation towards the implementation of the DT for cities, which is breaking the silo-based approach to integrate the data and the models in an open, harmonized, interoperable ecosystem (Bauer et al., 2021 a; Nochta et al., 2019, 2021; Petrova-Antonova and Ilieva, 2021).

Historically, 3D city models helped to overcome the limitations of 2D objects representations (Herbert and Chen, 2015; Lehner and Dorffner, 2020).

Traditionally, 3D city models are usually created from existing 2D and 3D geodata sets generally acquired by aerial images (oblique photogrammetry) and Li DAR point clouds (Xue et al., 2020). To support the process of producing 3D city models, many geodata workflows are in practice that allow the public administrations and organizations upgrading to 3D their geodata ((Ledoux et al., 2021); Lehner and Dorffner, 2020).

Thus, the application and the usability of the 3D city model are important (Billen et al., 2014). 3D city modeling is not only about data acquisition and processing, it is also inextricably linked to the data management, storage and exchange.

Third, the DTs are conceptualized to apply further analysis and simulations on top of visualizations. While it is outside the scope of this article to list all existing DTs since some initiatives could be confidential and the data collection from the grey literature could be overwhelming. An overview of some of the most ongoing projects around the world is discussed in more detail and for which the necessary information is available.

Hence, considering DTs for cities as systems of systems is the most highlighted track, e. g., 15 papers have defined DTs for cities as a digital representation of the city elements that function as an ecosystem of twin systems without narrowing the scope to the 3D components. The analysis of the definitions reflects the key features and main components of DTs for cities. We primarily f",

Such definition diversity leads to ambiguities among practitioners, which motivated us to conduct this work to bridge the gap between the concepts and current realizations of DT for cities.

The traditional engineering conceptualisation of DTs is characterised by a set of virtual information constructs that fully describe a potential or actual physical manufactured product from the micro-atomic level to the macro-geometrical level (Barricelli et al., 2019; Grieves, 2016). However, DTs are increasingly promoted as tools for managing complex Multi-Actor Systems (MASs) (Enserink et al., 2022) and Socio Ecological-Technological Systems (SETs) (Sharifi, 2023), such as cities, forests and oceans (Oti-Sarpong et al., 2022; Tagarakis et al., 2024; Tzachor et al., 2023).

The term ‘live coupling’ (e. g., through real-time data feeds) is problematic and contested in the context of UDTs, as it is often difficult to achieve for MAS, SET systems and s. a. cities, and, for many applications – such as longterm scenario planning – it is unnecessary.

A recurring theme across the perspectives is the need to ensure broad and fair access to UDTs for all stakeholders. These shared and divergent views contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how UDTs are perceived within the urban governance context. RQ3: To what extent can a Q study be used to support a UDT innovation in the regional urban network in the Netherlands? The Q method interviews were engaging and sparked curiosity among participants.

By applying Q methodology within a regional actor-network, we provide conceptual and empirical insights into how diverse stakeholder perspectives shape UDT innovation.

While too much ambiguity can lead to fragmentation and misalignment, too little can stifle innovation by imposing rigid definitions that exclude alternative perspectives. A productive middle ground is essential—UDTs must be flexible enough to accommodate different interpretations while structured enough to support collaboration. An important direction for future research is identifying where this balance should be struck in practice. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) further clarifies that UDTs do not evolve in isolation but through dynamic interactions among policymakers, technologists, urban planners, and citizens.

Introduction The concept of a Digital Twin (DT) traces its origins to a book titled Mirrored Worlds published three decades ago [1]. Various terms have been coined subsequently, e. g. Mirrored Space Model (MSM) and Information Mirroring Model (IMM), and later ‘‘Conceptual Ideal for Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)’’ by [2], evolving the discourse with defining the main components of a DT. Since then, the term has evolved to encompass a broad spectrum of concepts and levels of fidelity, ranging from static models to dynamic simulations with real-time data integration and even autonomous capabilities (from a data visualization tool to a fully autonomous decision making system such as au",

Despite the growing interest in DTs within the built environment, the concept has been reported to remain unclear for many practitioners and researchers [30,31], unlike in some other industries such as Manufacturing [32] and Aerospace [33] where it appears to be converging toward a well-established consensus. The rapid growth of interest in emergent technologies such as DTs can lead to fragmented knowledge about its core functionalities and key elements. This fragmentation often results in ambiguities across industry and research papers concerning its precise definition [32,34– 37], its essential components and minimum functionalities for a system to be considered a DT, and how it is applied specifically within the BE.

However, not all of them accurately capture the exact essence of a Digital Twin. Amplifying this confusion, researchers have defined DTs from one or more perspectives, often vaguely, leading to a range of interpretations ( Table 1).

Introduction Cities have become increasing smarter in the last two decades (Albino et al., 2013), using pervasive information and communications technology (ICT) to monitor activities in the city (Neirotti et al., 2014). Data can then be generated from a wide variety of activities in the city, such as traffic and transportation (Menouar et al., 2017), power generation (Oldenbroek et al., 2017), utilities provisioning (S´anchez et al., 2013), water supply (Parra et al., 20",

Smart cities can then use this data to improve the mobility, environment, living standards and governance of the city (Abella et al., 2017; Angelidou, 2015). A strong link has been shown between investing in smart city policies and urban GDP growth (Caragliu & Del Bo, 2019). The data generated by smart cities makes them exciting testbeds for data mining and machine learning (Mohammadi & Al-Fuqaha, 2018; White & Clarke, 2020). The services provided to citizens in a smart city can be personalised using machine learning, internet of things and big data (Chin et al., 2017; White, Palade, et al., 2019).

More recent neural network approaches, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) can be used to optimize crowd routing in a smart city (Zhao et al., 2019). In the digital twin layer reinforcement learning algorithms can also be used to learn the best action policies to improve performance in a number of urban intelligence tasks, such as managing traffic and power systems (Hsu et al., 2014; Mannion et al., 2016).

Digital twins have primarily been used in the manufacturing sector, but other areas of study and business are beginning to find new potential uses.

In future work, we plan to evaluate a concert simulation that would see an influx of pedestrian and vehicle traffic attempting to reach the Three Arena in Dublin (capacity 13,000). Simulations could investigate the placement of fire evacuation points as well as the effect that increasing the capacity of the stadium would have on the traffic and fire evacuation policy.

Introduction Sustainable urban development is increasingly recognized as a global imperative, calling for innovative solutions to navigate the complex dynamics of contemporary urban environments (Son et al., 2023). In this evolving landscape, Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have emerged as transformative tools, simulating and analyzing urban scenarios to offer nuanced insights into city functioning (Haraguchi et al., 2024; Ivanov et al., 2020; Lei, Janssen, et al., 2023). Originally rooted in aerospace, the concept of Digital Twins has broadened its reach, proving instrumental across various domains, including urban management, thereby setting the stage for a new paradigm in urban planning and development (Deng et al., 2021; Elkefi & Asan, 2022; Francisco et al",

Wang & Vu, 2023; Weil et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Tao & Qi, 2019). Ideally, this relationship is bidirectional, leading to decisionmaking and interventions in the real world (Luo, Liu, & Cao, 2022; Weil et al., 2023).

Digital twins based on Io T and edge computing can leverage vast amounts of environmental data for (near)-real-time analysis (Dai & Zhang, 2022; Durana et al., 2022). For instance, monitoring indicators such as traffic flow, air quality, and crowd density within a city allows for a more accurate understanding of changes. Additionally, UDTs can simulate human behaviours, providing insights into human perceptions and reactions to the urban environment. Overall, the value of UDTs in urban environmental research lies in their ability to conduct multidimensional scenario simulations and predictive analyses of landscapes, furnishing city managers with more comprehensive and accurate decision-making foundations.

Conclusion This research proposes a pathway for built environment characteristics evaluation and perception that combines objective feature analysis with subjective perceptions based on an urban digital twin we designed and developed. The idea of an urban digital twin is to replicate the realworld and test scenarios before they are built, driving their implementation in the real-world, which we have accomplished by integrating an automat",

By applying the Mindsponge Theory, we were able to better interpret the subjective visual perceptions gathered from participants and relate them to the objective environmental features quantified by the digital twin. Objective feature analysis involves using an advanced Deep Lab V3 deep learning algorithm for pixel-level semantic segmentation of continuous panoramic images, which could quantify different features (e. g. green visibility and sky exposure) in the urban environment.

Digital twins, as an innovative approach, bear substantial potential in the analysis of urban environments, serving as a pivotal method to elevate the interaction between humans and their surroundings. The integration of public perceptions into UDTs is crucial for establishing a bidirectional connection between the ‘digital platform—public perception—physical environment.’ This integration encapsulates a specific manifestation of the sustainable urban development concept centred around the public.

Introduction Cities are the systems of networks and flows (Batty, 2013) of which urban sidewalks are a crucial component (Hosseini, Miranda, Lin, & Silva, 2022; Ning, Ye, Chen, Liu, & Cao, 2022). Sidewalks function not only for transportation and everyday commute but also as a carrier for social interactions and recreational physical activities (Liu, Zhang, Jin, & Liu, 2020), i. e., walking, that promote active lifestyles (Kelly, Schootman, Baker, Barnidge, & Lemes, 2007). In the urban environment, increased walking activities benefit the city from various perspectives, from air pollution reduction to urban spaces safety maintenance; it is also an essential measure of the life quality of a community (Ataman & Tuncer, 2022; Bicycle, 2008; Blacklock, Rhodes, &",

Therefore, designing and maintaining sidewalks for pedestrians is one of the key focuses of urban planners to develop a healthier and happier city. In recent years, human perceptions have become a useful measurement to assess urban outdoor environment (Abdollahzadeh & Biloria, 2021; Bivina & Parida, 2022; Deng et al., 2021; Florio et al., 2021; ∗ Corresponding author at: Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

During the walking activity on the sidewalks, people perceive multisensory experiences (e. g., thermal experience, surrounding traffics) interacting with a series of urban spatial objects (e. g., buildings, trees, roadconditions)thatimpacttheirstateofcomfortwhennavigatingand path-finding in the urban realm (Gao et al., 2022). Previous research primarily focused on the thermal experiences (i. e., thermal comfort) of the pedestrians, which are essential to understanding the relationship between urban micro-climate and spatial urban morphology (Nice et al., 2022; Vasilikou & Nikolopoulou, 2020) and also as an indicator of the sidewalk quality (Abdollahzadeh & Bilori",

However, thermal comfort measures do not capture a complete comprehension of the walking experience in the environment, particularly in the outdoor settings where the inter-play between pedestrians and spatial objects along the walking is constantly changing (Bivina & Parida, 2022). The sense of the crowdedness of the road, safety, fear or willingness to walk in the sun, the slope condition of the roads, and other facets can heavily affect human comfort when walking on the routes (Guan et al., 2022; Meng & Kang, 2016; Miranda, Fan, Duarte, & Ratti, 2021; Natapov https://doi. org/10.1016/j. scs.2023.104480 Received 30 December 2022; Accepted 8 February 2023\n\nSustainable Citiesand So",

In the studies of urban sidewalks, previous research shows that personal experience of the urban continuum is perceived in a dynamic nature (Potvin, 2000). The sequential manner of pedestrians experiencing the interconnected urban spaces reinforces such a dynamic perceptual mode through the actual movement between spaces (Vasilikou & Nikolopoulou, 2020), as shown in Fig. 1.

Each cell is connected to the building object’s nodes (e. g., walls, windows, doors) in the graph structure when the cell is within the building objects’ area of influence (Ao I, e. g., fan radius). For a person in the building, the location of the cells also represents where the person is.

However, three primary deficiencies of the model inhibit its direct employment in our study. First, the outdoor surroundings are much more complicated than the indoor environment.

Fourth, driven by the goal of AI for social good (Tomašev et al., 2020), we will use this model to study sidewalk walkabilities at an urban scale with more participants and scenarios. We hope to integrate such a model in the DT platform to achieve a near real-time comfort prediction to support downstream applications, such as human-oriented comfort-driven navigation.

In summary, this paper introduced a spatio-temporal-explicit Geo AI model to predict outdoor human comforts using crowdsourced data and dynamic graphs.

In PLM, DTs involve three essential components: ‘(a) physical products in Real Space, (b) virtual products in Virtual Space, and (c) the connections of data and information that ties the virtual and real products together’ (Grieves, 2014: 1). It is the reciprocal connection of physical and virtual components or counterparts that enables the DT to fulfil its main function as a mechanism for iterative feedback and control of the production process. The flow of data from physical to virtual enables the virtual system to match or ‘mirror’ the current state of its physical counterpart.

New information generated through the application of computer modelling, simulation, and analysis performed on the virtual model can then be fed back into the physical manufacturing process to effect desired changes. During early development, the concept was described using several different terminologies including ‘mirrored spaces’, ‘information mirroring’, and the ‘virtual doppelganger’ (Grieves, 2023). The term ‘digital twin’ was adopted more recently in the 2010 s after Grieves met his colleague John Vickers at NASA, who coined it during their collaboration. DTs can be linked to a range of other concepts involving the creation of digital representations and their communication with physical entities.

Each of these share conceptual overlaps and are often implemented using similar technologies. However, each also has its own distinct origin, motivation, and developmental trajectory.

We begin by outlining the conceptual development of DTs within the originating context of PLM. We then discuss their reception within the field of urban planning and modelling, paying particular attention to the use of mirroring and twinning metaphors to illustrate the concept. In doing so, we outline their insufficiency for grounding a definition of DTs that applies universally across different application domains and propose an alternative. Our primary contribution is to reorientate the general understanding of DTs by reference to Grieves’ own framing of them as a ‘conceptual model’ and ‘ideal’ rather than a particular technology (Grieves, 2014, 2023; G",

This, we argue, can be grasped independently of the metaphors typically deployed to illustrate the concept.

Combining these perspectives affords a critical model for the understanding of DTs that remains sensitive to their challenges and limitations as mechanisms of control, but is cautiously optimistic regarding their potential for advancing participation in relation to the planning and governance of cities.

Grieves (2014) further proposed that DTs should be ‘indistinguishable from their physical counterparts’ (p. 1). This is achieved by ensuring that the state of the virtual counterpart is updated using data to representationally ‘mirror’ the current state and behaviour of its physical counterpart.

This information is expressly intended to help determine the most ‘desirable’ possible outcomes, which are then enacted through automation or human intervention. In this regard, DTs offer a form of ‘steering representation’ (Korenhof et al., 2021). In the case of cities, the kinds of monitoring and sensing infrastructures employed for these purposes can further the centralisation and intensification of control in ways already associated with smart cities and platform capitalism. However, with appropriate governance and participation, they could instead be directed to better serve the collective benefit of citizens and society as a whole. Following Calzati and Van Loe",

Hence, ‘buil[t] on an interplay of human choices, technological affordances, while being employed to serve humanly chosen goals’, urban societies might find themselves ‘together behind the steering wheel’ (Korenhof et al., 2021: 1766).

Introduction The accelerating process of global urbanization has led to increasingly complex urban environments and a growing array of challenges, placing growing demands on contemporary urban planning and governance (Wang et al., 2023 a; Ajjur and Al-Ghamdi, 2022). Understanding how people perceive the built environment and how they participate in decision-making has therefore become critical (Wu et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2023 a). Traditional urban planning methods, such as static surveys and isolated consultations, often fail to capture dynamic public feedback, leading to outcomes that do not fully meet societal needs (Luo et al., 2025 b; Liu et al., 2023).

Crucially for citizen-centric planning, UDTs offer powerful tools for assessing built environments and facilitating public engagement across the entire planning lifecycle (Ferré-Bigorra et al., 2022).

The perception-powered urban studies Building on environmental psychology, built environment perception refers to how individuals and groups interpret and respond to their surroundings. It is a cognitive-affective appraisal of urban space encompassing sensory, psychological, and behavioural dimensions such as visual quality, perceived safety, accessibility, and social ambience (Zhou and Tan, 2024; Luo et al., 2022 b; Wang et al., 2019).

Foundational works, such as Lynch’s The Image of the City (Lynch, 1964), highlighted the importance of visual coherence, spatial organization, and functional elements in shaping urban perception (Filomena et al., 2019), while subsequent studies link built environment perception to safety, comfort and social interaction that shape mobility and place attachment (Zhang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2023). Understanding these perceptions is critical because they directly inform urban design and policy (Liu et al., 2023). Frameworks from environmental psychology, cognitive science and landscape architecture all stress its multidimensional nature: visual appeal, social dynamics, functional convenience, and perceived risk (Gifford, 2014; Taupin et al., 2023).

Conversely, negative perceptions signal environmental stress and guide targeted interventions (Stanislav and Chin, 2019). As cities evolve, the role of built environment perception in urban planning has become increasingly significant (Jo and Jeon, 2020).

UDTs provide an innovative pathway to operationalize these ideas. By coupling realtime data with immersive 3D visualization, they allow stakeholders to evaluate how design changes, such as new street layouts, might impact user experiences, including pedestrian comfort and perceived safety (Ferré-Bigorra et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2025 a).

However, traditional methods of public participation, such as public hearings and surveys, face notable limitations. These approaches often provide limited engagement opportunities, struggle to attract broad and representative participation, and suffer from asymmetric information, where citizens lack access to comprehensive planning data (Akmentina, 2023; Kingston, 2007).

Similarly, a ‘thermal comfort metric’ could be developed by linking self-reported comfort levels with real-time microclimate data from Io T sensors and solar radiation models (Schrotter and Hürzeler, 2020).

The creation of foundational geospatial layers for rural UDTs, once hindered by data scarcity, is now increasingly feasible through automated feature extraction from very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and wide-area UAV surveys (Sun et al., 2024). These RS technologies enable the systematic mapping of infrastructure, land use, and environmental quality at regional scales, providing the essential geospatial backbone to develop UDTs beyond dense urban cores. Scale-specific gaps were also evident. Most implementations (78%) hav",

Most implementations (78%) have been localized at a single meso-scale (neighbourhood or city), with very few studies tackling micro-scale sites or macro-scale regions (White et al., 2021; Abdelrahman et al., 2025). Cross-scale analyses and multi-site comparisons are particularly rare, which raises concerns about the generalizability and scalability of current UDT findings (Wang et al., 2023 b; Villanueva-Merino et al., 2024).

In such a framework, macro-scale environmental parameters derived from satellite platforms like Landsat or Sentinel-2 (e. g., land surface temperature, greenness indices) would provide the dynamic boundary conditions for meso-scale city models. These models, in turn, could be enriched with micro-scale details captured by street-level imagery and Li DAR, creating a seamless, cross-scalar analytical continuum that is currently missing in the domain Chen et al.

Technology-participation coupling and equity concerns The coupling between technological choices and participatory outcomes emerged as a pivotal theme, carrying significant equity implications (White et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2025 a). On one hand, UDTs are increasingly designed to support richer forms of interaction, signalling an intentional linkage of technology and participation (Ham and Kim, 2020; Adade and de Vries, 2023).

When properly implemented, these advanced visualization and interaction tools can amplify citizens’ ability to perceive, comprehend, and influence urban projects (Sabri et al., 2016; Kavouras et al., 2023). On the other hand, this reliance on sophisticated technology raises critical equity concerns. A significant number of projects still lack robust engagement mechanisms, and the high cost of specialized hardware like VR headsets can inadvertently exclude less advantaged communities, thus widening the digital divide (Li et al., 2023; Ta",

This involves using UDTs as platforms that combine in-depth local engagement (e. g., community workshops, living labs) with broadscale, map-based crowdsourcing of perceptual data, thereby scaling up inclusivity to larger populations (Park et al., 2024; White et al., 2021). • Diverse context integration via RS: To address",

This means creating lightweight, web-based geovisualization platforms based on PPGIS principles, which can deliver critical EO-derived environmental insights on standard devices, thus democratizing UDT adoption for resource-constrained communities (Adreani et al., 2024; Weng et al., 2024). • Smart integration of geospatial AI: The technology-participation nex",

Stargel defined the digital twin as the integration of multidisciplinary and multiscale simulation processes by making full use of physical models, sensors, operational history and other data. The digital twin acts as a mirror image of the physical product in virtual space and reflects the full life cycle of the physical entity.3 In 2017, the concept of a “digital twin city” was first proposed by CAICT and used in the planning and",

Introduction As cities worldwide shift toward sustainable transportation, electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy integration have become essential in reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability (Al-Thani et al., 2022; Cao et al., 2021). Global EV sales surged by 35% in 2023, reaching 17 million projected by 2024 (IEA, 2024). While growth is strongest in China, the U.

Existing studies rely heavily on static mathematical and optimization models that oversimplify EV behaviors and interactions with infrastructure (Asna et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2023). Micro-level approaches, particularly agent-based modeling (ABM) using simulation software, have emerged to capture EV drivers’ daily travel patterns and charging behaviors (Rasca et al., 2024; Lopez et al., 2021; Marmaras et al., 2017; Novosel et al., 2015; Wang and Infield, 2018).

Few decision-support tools assess how policies like smart charging incentives affect EV behavior and satisfaction (Kam et al., 2019).

During the meeting, we also invited a group of students whom we co-supervised in a master’s project to test and demonstrate a web application on real ocean observation systems.

We identify which device drivers are required, install the drivers, and ensure they are compatible with the platform.

Integrating a GPS sensor in an office setting is a typical example of this problem. The target system is too large for an office, and testing on a tractor in the field is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, engineers often detach the hardware from the target system and place it in a laboratory environment. However, if a sensor only works as intended in the field, this problem becomes even more severe and can have a significant impact on the entire development process. Silage Control conducted their",

First, some sensor drivers worked in older versions of ROS but not in the current LTS version. For instance, when the last LTS version (Noetic) for ROS, Version 1, was released in 2021, some of their drivers only supported the previous version (ROS Melodic).

The Challenges for Product Customization and Quality Assurance The third part of the interview was about the customization of Silage Control and the quality assurance workflow. As Silage Control is already built on a modular software architecture, changing sensors and their drivers is thought along the development of the system. Moreover, it is difficult to properly mount the sensor bar, since tractors and other argicultural machines are not standardized and different manufacturers exists. With regard to the customization of the sensor bar, Silage Control learned from their first experiments: “[During our first trials], we had to [manually] position the system [(the single sensors)] p",

Additionally, we have standardized the rail’s structure, which allows for calibration routines to run beforehand, and the sensors to calibrate themselves automatically. As a result, there is no need for pinpoint accuracy during installation. Before, it was nearly impossible to align everything perfectly. Now, our system is plug-andplay, making it easier to install.

Since these sensors can be quite expensive, the team does not have any spare sensors to use during this time. Therefore, the team has already considered using simulations to simulate the tractor and sensor bar, and to obtain a virtual context.

The research on shareability networks was later expanded with a focus on fleet size and vehicle-sharing networks [75], finding a potential to reduce the New York city taxi fleet size by 30 percent. Such a potential reduction follows directly from a reorganization of taxi dispatching that could be implemented with a mobile phone app and does not assume ride sharing, nor requires",

This history shows a transition towards car-centricity in the 20 th century for most cities, entailing critical consequences on the whole system, for example: over 1.3 Mio. people die on the road every year [78], vehicular pollution causes millions of more yearly deaths [79], and vehicular",

Using short-term traffic engineering thinking has lead to the outdated “predict and provide” logic, where e. g. traffic volumes are predicted from past flows and the role of policy makers is to react by providing a short-term solution. On the contrary, following systems thinking, this logic is replaced with the more adequate “decide and provide” principle, which aims to pro-actively shape the future [95].
