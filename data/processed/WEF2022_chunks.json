Cities are home to the majority of the world’s population and generate more than 80% of GDP. Rapid urbanization has also brought about new challenges as cities have struggled with congestion, pollution, increased carbon emissions, inequity and exposure to natural disasters such as floods and storms. The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have further intensified these issues.
